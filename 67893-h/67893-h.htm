</div>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>: This book is a complete
story in itself, but forms the eighth volume in a
line issued under the general title, “The Second
Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.”</p>

<p>As related in the First Series, this line of books
was started with the publication of “The Rover
Boys at School,” in which I introduced my readers
to Dick, Tom and Sam Rover and their
friends and relatives. This First Series, consisting
of twenty volumes, told of what happened to
these three Rover boys while attending Putnam
Hall Military Academy, Brill College, and while
on outings in this country and abroad. When the
boys became married Dick Rover was blessed
with a son and a daughter, as was also his brother
Sam, while Tom became the parent of a lively
pair of twin boys.</p>

<p>From their homes in New York City the four
younger Rovers went to boarding school, as related
in the first volume of the Second Series,
entitled “The Rover Boys at Colby Hall.” From
that school the scene was shifted to “Snowshoe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
Island” and then to doings while “Under Canvas.”
Then the boys went “On a Hunt,” and,
later, to “The Land of Luck.” Then came exciting
days at “Big Horn Ranch” and at “Big
Bear Lake,” where we last met them. In the
present volume the scene is shifted to the Atlantic
Ocean. The boys were shipwrecked and had
many thrilling adventures.</p>

<p>As many of my readers know, the sale of this
series of books is now well past the <em>three million</em>
mark. To me, this seems truly wonderful. My
only hope is that the reading of these books will
do all of the boys and girls good.</p>

<p>Affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>

<p>“Battalion, attention!”</p>

<p>The command came from Major Jack Rover.
The scene was the campus of Colby Hall Military
Academy, and drawn up in front of the youthful
major were the three companies of cadets. It
was a clear day in November and the boys made
an inspiring appearance in their well fitting uniforms.
Every rifle was in the pink of condition,
as were also the drums, fifes and bugles of the
musicians.</p>

<p>“Present arms!” was the next command, and
as the students held their rifles before them, Captain
Mapes Dale, the military instructor, passed
in front of one company after another. He was
followed by Colonel Colby and Professor
Grawson.</p>

<p>“The cadets certainly make a fine showing,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
remarked Colonel Colby, after the brief inspection
had come to an end.</p>

<p>“They do indeed, Colonel,” answered Captain
Dale. “They have never turned out better.
We’ll have to congratulate Major Rover. He
certainly keeps the boys well in hand.”</p>

<p>The owner of the military academy and his
aids came to the front once more, and then
Captain Dale nodded to the young major. This
was a signal that the youthful commander could
now proceed with the usual morning routine.</p>

<p>“Shoulder arms! Forward march!” came the
quick, clear command.</p>

<p>Then the drums struck up, followed by the
lively pipings of the fifes, and the three companies
of cadets moved forward across the campus
and around the school buildings, finally
coming to a halt in front of the entrance to the
mess hall. There the cadets broke ranks, placed
away their guns, swords and other equipments,
and piled into the mess hall, where all were speedily
seated at the numerous dining tables.</p>

<p>“That ends parading for some time to
come,” remarked Captain Fred Rover, of Company
C.</p>

<p>“And I’m not sorry,” returned Andy Rover,
his cousin.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the Thanksgiving holidays!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
burst out Randy, Andy’s twin. “Won’t we have
a dandy time at home?”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget that invitation from Ralph
Mason,” came from Jack.</p>

<p>“Hoopla! Me for a life on the ocean wave!”
burst out Andy. “Ralph says that motor boat is
a dandy.”</p>

<p>“If only the weather stays clear!” said Fred,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, a little less noise, please,”
came from Professor Snopper Duke, who chanced
to be at the head of the table at which the four
Rovers were seated.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Sorry I spoke, sir,” mumbled
Andy, and slyly put his tongue in one cheek, at
which his twin brother and his cousins grinned.</p>

<p>All of the cadets were in high spirits, and with
good reason—school was to close that afternoon
for the Thanksgiving holidays. Nearly all of
the cadets were going either home or elsewhere,
so that only a handful would be left at the academy
for ten days. Usually the Thanksgiving
recess was shorter, but Colonel Colby wished to
take advantage of the holidays by having some
necessary repairs done to the mess hall ceiling,
which was in danger of coming down.</p>

<p>Before Jack Rover had been elected major of
the school battalion, Ralph Mason had occupied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
that important position. Now Ralph had left
Colby Hall for good, but he still retained his
affection for many of the lads there, and had
invited the Rover boys and two of their chums,
Gif Garrison and Dick Powell, to accompany him
on a motor-boat trip from Woods Hole to Marthas
Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod—the
proposed outing, of course, being contingent upon
the condition of the weather.</p>

<p>“I only hope the folks at home won’t object to
our taking that motor-boat trip,” remarked Fred,
after the meal was over and the boys were preparing
to go to their classrooms.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can object,” came from
Randy. “It will be perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will be safe,” returned his twin
brother. “There won’t a thing happen to
us.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so, anyway,” said Jack. “We’ve
had adventure enough. Gracious, just look at
what happened at Big Horn Ranch and at Big
Bear Lake! After all those doings, I’m willing
to sit down and take it easy.”</p>

<p>“No sitting down for me,” broke in Andy, and
in high spirits he dropped his school books and
turned a cartwheel in the corridor.</p>

<p>“Andy Rover, what do you mean by such conduct
in the school building?” came in a cold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
clear-cut voice, and the boys saw Professor Duke
standing in a doorway close behind them.</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me, sir. I didn’t know any one
was looking,” stammered the fun-loving Rover.</p>

<p>“After this reserve your gymnastic exercises
for the gymnasium,” was the professor’s sarcastic
command as he turned away.</p>

<p>“My, but he’s a real sociable fellow!” was
Randy’s whispered comment.</p>

<p>“And we thought he had turned over a new
leaf,” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“It must be bred in the bone,” was the way
Fred expressed himself.</p>

<p>The gong was now sounding, and all of the
cadets hurried to their various classrooms, and
were soon deep in their studies or recitations.
Although they liked fun, Andy and Randy especially,
the Rovers knew that they must make
good records at the Academy, or otherwise there
would be trouble when they faced their fathers
and mothers.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, the agony will be over by half-past
two this afternoon,” remarked Andy to his
brother, “and by four-thirty we’ll be on our way
home.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose the girls will be on hand?”
questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“Yes. Jack said Martha telephoned in early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
this morning. And she said she might have a
surprise.”</p>

<p>“A surprise?” came from Fred. “How is
that?”</p>

<p>“Martha wouldn’t say, because, she said, the
whole thing might fall through.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder Jack didn’t make her tell!
What do you suppose those girls have up their
sleeve?”</p>

<p>“Search me! You can’t make Martha open her
mouth when she wants to keep silent. She’s
not one of the kind of girls to tell everything
she knows.”</p>

<p>“Did she say Mary was in on the secret?” questioned
Fred. Mary was his sister, and the two
girls attended Clearwater Hall, a school for girls
in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“Didn’t say a word about Mary,” put in Jack,
thus appealed to.</p>

<p>“Maybe she didn’t say anything about Ruth
Stevenson, either?” came from Andy, slyly, and
his manner was such that the young major found
himself blushing in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we’ll just have to wait and
see what’s doing,” sighed Randy.</p>

<p>The last day in school before a holiday is usually
not so strictly observed as some others. The
cadets, however, had to go through their usual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
recitations, interrupted only by the time taken
for lunch. Then at half-past two the dismissal
bell rang, and the cadets rushed hither and thither
in their anxiety to pack and get away.</p>

<p>“Look at the autos outside, will you?” came
from Gif Garrison, who had stopped to speak
to Jack about the proposed trip with Ralph Mason.
“I’ll say some fellows are in luck.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” came from Dick Powell, usually
called Spouter by his chums. “I’d rather ride in
an auto ten times over than in a stuffy train.
Just think of rolling along through the country
with all the foliage at its very best. Think of the
trees tipped with crimson and gold, the mountainsides
looking like——”</p>

<p>“There, Spouter, that will do for the present,”
interrupted Jack, good-naturedly. “You can
spout all you please about the scenery when we
are off on our trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! you fellows have no eye for
beauty,” grumbled Spouter, in disgust. “I don’t
believe you know whether the tree leaves are red,
yellow, green or pink.”</p>

<p>“Hi there, Jack! Come here!” came in a yell
from Fred, who had run out on the campus.
“Here’s a surprise!”</p>

<p>Jack broke away from a number of his friends
and ran down to where Fred was standing. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
two Rovers were quickly joined by Andy and
Randy.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s dad!” came from Andy. “Dad and
Uncle Sam!”</p>

<p>“And they’ve got the two autos with them!”
answered his twin, dancing up and down in excitement.</p>

<p>“Say, was that the secret Martha was keeping?”
demanded Jack, rushing up and shaking his two
uncles by the hand. And then, before they could
answer, he went on: “Where’s my dad? Why
didn’t he come?”</p>

<p>“Your father had to remain in New York,”
answered Tom Rover. “Somebody has to run
the business, you know. We can’t all go holidaying,”
and his eyes twinkled, showing that he
was just as full of fun as he had been when at
the age of his twin sons.</p>

<p>“Yes, we telephoned to Martha. But we told
her to keep it a secret because we were afraid that
something might hold us back,” explained Sam
Rover.</p>

<p>“Why, Dad, you’ve got a new car!” burst out
Fred. “What do you know about that! Some
swell outfit, I’ll say,” he added, gazing at the
new automobile admiringly. It was a big twelve-cylinder
sedan, and looked to be the acme of comfort
and mechanical perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>In a few minutes the boys learned that they
were to leave the school by automobile and pick
up the two Rover girls at Clearwater Hall on the
way. Ruth Stevenson was to accompany Martha
and Mary.</p>

<p>“Martha said Ruth’s folks are away on a tour,”
explained Tom Rover. “So she is to spend
the holidays with us.”</p>

<p>“Well, that will suit Jack all right enough,”
said Randy quickly.</p>

<p>“Don’t you all like Ruth?” demanded the
young major.</p>

<p>“Sure, we do!” came promptly from the others,
and then, somehow, Jack felt better.</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard all of the secret yet,” Tom
Rover said, grinning at his twin sons and his
two nephews. “Shall I tell them?” he went on,
turning to his brother Sam.</p>

<p>“Why not let them find it out for themselves?”
came quickly from Fred’s father. And then,
turning to the lads, he continued: “You don’t
know where you are going, boys, but you’re on
the way.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that we’re not going
home?” came from all four cadets in a chorus of
wonder.</p>

<p>“You are not,” replied Tom Rover. “But
don’t ask any more questions. Go ahead and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
get ready to leave. We have a long ride ahead
of us, and we don’t want to drive any farther
than is necessary after dark.”</p>

<p>While the Rover boys were saying good-bye to
their chums and getting ready to make the trip,
Tom Rover and his brother Sam went in to call
on their old school chum, Colonel Colby.</p>

<p>“It’s a touch of old times to see you fellows
again,” said Larry Colby, as he shook hands
warmly. “It’s too bad Dick didn’t come with
you. Then we’d have the old quartette,” and he
smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“Well, time is bound to scatter us,” remarked
Sam Rover. “Some of the fellows are scattered
to the four quarters of the globe. About all the
old crowd I ever see are Songbird Powell, Fred
Garrison and Hans Mueller.”</p>

<p>Knowing that they had a long run ahead of
them, the Rover boys lost no time in getting ready
for the trip. Then their suitcases were stowed
away and they climbed into the two cars, the
twins with their father and the others with Sam
Rover.</p>

<p>It did not take long to run to Haven Point and
then along the lake to Clearwater Hall. Here
they found a number of automobiles parked
along the campus and many girl students coming
and going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“There they are!” called out Jack, and waved
his hand. In a moment more his sister Martha
came running toward them, followed by Mary
Rover and Ruth Stevenson.</p>

<p>“How about the surprise, Jack?” cried Martha,
her face beaming.</p>

<p>“Peachy!” answered her brother, promptly.
“Couldn’t be better!”</p>

<p>“Did you suspect?” questioned Mary.</p>

<p>“Not at all. We thought the folks were all
too busy in Wall Street to come up here just
now.”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Hold on!” interrupted Sam Rover.
“They don’t know where they’re going yet.
Don’t spoil things.”</p>

<p>“They don’t!” burst out Mary. “Why, I
thought——”</p>

<p>“No, that’s to be a surprise,” said Tom Rover.
“Don’t tell them a word. Let them find out for
themselves. It will give them something to think
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, this certainly is a mystery,” murmured
Fred, and he and his cousins looked blankly at
each other.</p>

<p>“It was splendid to invite me to go along,” remarked
Ruth Stevenson, as she shook hands
warmly with the young major and the others.
“Just splendid!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“We’re glad to have you, Ruth,” answered
Sam Rover.</p>

<p>The boys assisted the girls with their luggage,
and a few minutes later the automobile trip was
begun. The twins rode with their father, and
Mary and Fred went with them, while Jack and
Martha, accompanied by Ruth, rode with their
Uncle Sam. As was to be expected, Tom Rover
led the way and set such a pace that his brother
had hard work to keep up with him.</p>

<p>“We figured out that we could reach a town
called Bridgeville in time for supper,” said Sam
Rover. “But I rather think we’ll have to hump
ourselves to do it.”</p>

<p>“I guess Uncle Tom is going to try to put one
over on you, Uncle Sam,” remarked Jack.
“Maybe he wants to show you that his old car
can outrun your new one.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, if he doesn’t get into trouble,”
answered Sam Rover.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind riding fast,” came from
Ruth, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “It’s
so good to be out of school once more!”</p>

<p>“Wish we were bound for Big Bear Lake,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, wouldn’t that be grand!”</p>

<p>“It would be unless some big bear came along
to eat us up,” put in Martha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we killed off all the bears,” said Jack.
And this remark made both of the girls giggle.</p>

<p>On and on sped the two cars, keeping just
within sight of each other. Up hill and down
hill they rolled, around broad curves, and over
solid stone bridges and some that were built of
wood and rattled loudly as they passed. The
weather was so warm that they had all the windows
down, so they could enjoy the fresh air to
its fullest.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose they are taking us?”
whispered Randy to his brother, as they rolled
swiftly along.</p>

<p>“Search me!” was the slangy answer.
“They’ve certainly got something up their sleeve.
I thought sure we were going home.”</p>

<p>“So did I.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the car guided by Sam Rover struck
a broad curve leading to the left. A little farther
on there was a crossroad, and presently through
the trees and bushes Fred’s father caught sight
of a long, low, yellow car on the other highway.
As this car was coming from his right, he at once
slackened his pace and blew his horn vigorously.</p>

<p>The occupants of the other car paid not the
slightest attention to the warning, but kept on,
faster, if possible, than ever. As a consequence,
Sam Rover had to jam on the brakes. Then, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
he came still closer to the crossroads, he prepared
to make the turn and run, if possible, with the
other car. Then came a wild tooting of the other
horn, and the yellow car attempted to make a
turn to the right to get into the highway on which
the Rovers were running.</p>

<p>But this turn proved disastrous, and in a
twinkling the yellow car rolled over and over,
landing in some bushes on the side of the road.
The Rovers’ car proceeded a distance of fifty
yards on the crossroad, and then came to a standstill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<small>SOMETHING ABOUT ALL THE ROVERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Oh, look at that auto!”</p>

<p>“It turned over and over!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they are killed?”</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries that came from
the occupants of Sam Rover’s car as the machine
came to a standstill. In the meanwhile the car
run by Tom Rover had disappeared around a
bend of the main highway.</p>

<p>“This certainly looks bad,” murmured Sam
Rover, as he leaped to the ground, accompanied
by Jack. Both ran back to the scene of the accident,
followed slowly and somewhat fearfully
by Martha and Ruth.</p>

<p>“Oh, suppose they are killed or terribly hurt?”
murmured the Rover girl to her chum.</p>

<p>“If they are hurt we’ll have to do what we
can for them,” answered Ruth. “I wonder if
there is any first-aid kit in your uncle’s machine?”</p>

<p>There had been several loud yells of alarm as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the low, yellow car turned over and over in the
bushes beside the highway. Now, however, as
Jack Rover and his uncle approached, there was
an ominous silence, the spinning wheels of the
machine coming to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>“There is one man!” cried the youthful major,
and pointed into some bushes where the legs of
an individual were floundering around in the air.
A few seconds later the man righted himself
and struggled to a nearby tree, dazed and bewildered.</p>

<p>“There is another fellow—under the auto!”
came from Sam Rover. “Come on! Let us get
him out before the machine has a chance to settle
down on him.”</p>

<p>The military training of uncle and nephew
stood them in good stead, and they knew exactly
what to do in this emergency. Close at hand was
a rail fence, and while Sam Rover strained with
might and main to keep the yellow car from turning
over on the man in the brushwood, Jack obtained
a fence rail. Rushing up with this, he
propped it against the machine to hold it in place.
Then he and his uncle grabbed the unknown man,
who was almost unconscious, and dragged him
to safety.</p>

<p>“Any more in the auto?” panted Jack, his
quick efforts having almost winded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see any.” Sam Rover turned to the
man who was leaning against the tree. “Were
there more than two of you?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“No!” bellowed that individual, glaring at the
Rovers. “You’ve got us in a fine fix, I must
say!” he went on sourly.</p>

<p>“I think you fellows were as much to blame
as any one,” answered Sam Rover, curtly.
“However, now is no time to quarrel. Your
friend seems to be pretty well used up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’s hurt as much as I am,”
said the other man, surlily. “I was pitched out
right on my head.” He was now rubbing the
back of his neck and his left shoulder. “For
all I know, something may be broken.”</p>

<p>Reasoning that the sour-faced individual would
not argue in this fashion if he were seriously
hurt, Sam Rover turned his attention to the other
man, and Jack did likewise. The young major
had noted a tiny watercourse close to where the
roads intersected, and now he ran to this and
brought back a capful of water. With this they
bathed the man’s face, so that he soon opened
his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p>“Any bones broken?” asked Jack’s uncle,
kindly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” The man pulled himself together
slowly, and then started to rise. “Gee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
but my back feels sore! We certainly came a
cropper, didn’t we?” and he grinned sheepishly
at the Rovers.</p>

<p>“I’m glad no one was killed,” said Sam Rover.</p>

<p>“See here! This is your fault,” howled the
other man, coming forward stiffly. “You had
no business to be racin’ on this road.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I was running as fast as you
were,” answered Jack’s uncle.</p>

<p>“I bet you wasn’t,” put in the other man, still
grinning. He turned to his companion in misfortune.
“I told you, Ferguson, not to hit ’er
up quite so fast. Some time you’ll climb a stone
wall and land in the cemetery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, Billings,” growled the man called
Ferguson. “I know what I was doin’. It was
this fellow’s fault, and he’s got to pay for the
damage done.”</p>

<p>“All right, make him pay,” was the good-natured
comment from Billings. Then suddenly
he began to chuckle. “I wonder how much of
the stuff we smashed, Bill,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Shut your jaw, you fool!” cried Ferguson.
“I say this fellow has got to pay for the damage
done.”</p>

<p>While the men were talking Jack and the two
girls had moved closer to the upset car to inspect
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, look, Jack!” whispered Ruth, suddenly.
“What is that running from it? Is it the gasoline?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.” The young major made
a closer inspection and began to sniff the air.
“It’s liquor. These fellows are carrying hooch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you ever!” murmured Martha, in
horror, for she had never had any use for liquor
in any form.</p>

<p>“Say, you get away from that car!” burst out
Bill Ferguson, in sudden alarm. “Get away
from there, I say!”</p>

<p>“They are carrying liquor. The car is loaded
with it, Uncle Sam!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes; and they have both been drinking,” answered
his uncle quickly. He turned to the two
men. “If you want to make a police affair of
this, I’m willing,” he continued sternly. “But
I’ll tell you right now, you’ll make a poor showing
in a police court.”</p>

<p>“Oh, call it off! Call it off, Ferguson!” interposed
Billings, as good-naturedly as ever. “I
ain’t making no kick, and half the cargo belongs
to me at that. Do you want us to get in bad
around here? Call it off, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’ to have this car busted up for
nothin’,” grumbled Ferguson. “However,” he
added hastily, “I suppose I’ll have to let it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
pass. We ain’t got any witnesses against you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be lucky if you both keep out of jail,”
answered Sam Rover, pointedly. “Carrying
liquor around like that is prohibited, and you
know it. I advise you to get out of the business
and stay out.” Jack’s uncle turned to those with
him. “Come on, and we’ll see if we can catch
up to your Uncle Tom.”</p>

<p>As the Rovers and Ruth left the vicinity of the
accident the two men watched them narrowly.
On the face of Billings there was a look of dismay,
while Ferguson appeared more sour than
ever. He glared sharply at Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll meet again some day, and under
different circumstances,” he remarked, with a
scowl.</p>

<p>“What awful men!” was Ruth’s comment, as
they climbed into the automobile once more. “I’d
hate to be alone and meet them.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they are, Uncle Sam?
A couple of liquor runners?”</p>

<p>“More than likely, Jack,” answered his uncle.
“But one thing is certain—this load of liquor will
never be delivered,” he added, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why they can’t obey the law and
leave liquor alone,” remarked Martha, as the car
was backed to the other road and then sent forward
in the direction Tom Rover had taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“There is too much money in it, that’s why,”
answered her uncle. “Some of these rum-runners—or
bootleggers, as they are called—have become
millionaires at the game. They sell all sorts
of the vilest kind of concoctions at exorbitant
prices.”</p>

<p>They ran on for several miles and then reached
a point where they found the other automobile
resting by the roadside.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know whether you were lost, strayed
or stolen,” called out Tom Rover, gayly. “What
happened? Did you get a puncture or just stop
to pick buttercups?”</p>

<p>“No. We’ve been dabbling in spirits,” answered
his brother, just as gayly.</p>

<p>“And we knocked the spirits out in one round,”
added Jack.</p>

<p>Then the story of the accident on the road was
narrated, the others listening with keen interest.</p>

<p>“Gee, I wish I’d been there!” declared Andy,
wistfully. “I’m never around when anything
like that happens!”</p>

<p>“Never around!” cried Fred. “If I know anything
about it, you’re generally in the thick of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad neither of the men was seriously
hurt, even if they are bootleggers,” remarked
Mary. “And as for their liquor, it served them
right to have it smashed and spilt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“I can tell you that one man, the fellow named
Bill Ferguson, was certainly mad,” said Jack to
his cousins. “He looked as if he wanted to chew
us up.”</p>

<p>“You’d better keep your eyes open in case you
meet him again,” remarked Randy.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t likely that we’ll ever meet again,”
replied the young major. But in this he was
mistaken. He was to meet Bill Ferguson
again and under the most thrilling of circumstances.</p>

<p>Once more the two automobiles proceeded on
their way. And while they are thus rolling along
let me take the opportunity to introduce my characters
more specifically.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, entitled “The
Rover Boys at School,” I introduced three
brothers, Dick, Tom and Sam Rover, who resided
at that time with their Uncle Randolph and their
Aunt Martha at Valley Brook Farm, a pleasant
country place in New York state. From the
farm the boys had been sent to Putnam Hall
Military Academy and, later on, to Brill College.
Then they had gone into business in Wall Street,
New York, under the name of The Rover Company.
Each had been married to a boyhood
sweetheart, and now the three families resided
in adjoining residences on Riverside Drive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
overlooking the beautiful Hudson River, in New
York City.</p>

<p>Not a long while after his marriage to Dora
Stanhope, Dick had been blessed with a son,
John, who was always called Jack, and a daughter,
Martha, who was a year younger than her
brother. To Sam Rover and his wife Grace had
come a daughter, Mary, and, about a year later, a
son, who was named Fred after an old school
chum, Fred Garrison. Tom and his wife, Nellie,
were blessed with a healthy pair of boy twins,
one called Andy, after his grandfather, Anderson,
and the other Randy, after Uncle Randolph.</p>

<p>As they resided side by side, the younger generation
of Rover boys, as well as their sisters,
were brought up very much as one large family.
At first the young folks were sent to some private
institutions of learning in the Metropolis. But
presently Andy and Randy, as well as the other
boys, began to develop such a propensity for fun
it was decided to send them to some stricter institution
of learning.</p>

<p>At that time Larry Colby was at the head of a
military academy, called Colby Hall. How Jack
and Fred and the twins were sent to that institution
of learning and what happened to them, has
already been related in the volume entitled “The
Rover Boys at Colby Hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>At the school the lads made many friends and
also a few enemies. Among their warmest
chums were Gif Garrison, the son of their fathers’
old friend, Fred Garrison, after whom Fred
Rover was named, and Spouter Powell, the son
of the older Rovers’ chum, John Powell, always
known as Songbird because of his propensity for
writing what he called poetry.</p>

<p>A term at Colby Hall had been followed by
some winter adventures on “Snowshoe Island.”
Then the boys had returned to school to go into
an encampment “Under Canvas.” Later still the
lads had gone on a great “Hunt,” which had been
productive of many adventures. Later still, after
another term at the military academy, where Jack
had gradually worked his way up from being an
under officer to becoming major of the school
battalion and where Fred had risen until he was
now the captain of Company C, the four boys,
along with several chums, had gone into “The
Land of Luck,” otherwise the great oil regions of
Texas and Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Spouter announced that his
father had purchased a place in the far West
called “Big Bear Ranch.” The boys were invited
to visit this place and had a glorious time in the
saddle and otherwise.</p>

<p>Colby Hall was located on Clearwater Lake not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
far from the town of Haven Point. On the other
side of the town was located Clearwater Hall, a
school for girls. Among the pupils at this institution
were Ruth Stevenson and also May Powell,
a cousin of Spouter Powell. Jack and the other
boys speedily became acquainted with these girls,
and later on induced their parents to allow Martha
and Mary to become pupils at the place.</p>

<p>Gif Garrison had often been a guest of the
Rovers. When his father became the owner of a
large bungalow at Big Bear Lake, the cadet received
permission to use the place for a summer
outing. How Gif, Spouter and the four Rover
boys went to this resort, and what stirring adventures
they had there with wild animals and with
some students from a rival academy, is told in the
volume preceding this, entitled “The Rover Boys
at Big Bear Lake.”</p>

<p>“We certainly had some wonderful happenings
at Big Bear Lake,” Fred had remarked when the
boys were returning to Colby Hall after their
outing. “I don’t believe we’ll ever have more
strenuous times than those.” But in this surmise
Fred was mistaken, as the pages which follow will
prove.</p>

<p>It was just growing dark when the two automobiles
entered Bridgeville and pulled up at the
leading hotel. Tom Rover had telephoned ahead,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and a substantial supper awaited the crowd, to
which, it is needless to state, all did full justice.
In spite of the narrow escape during the
ride, all of the young folks were in the best of
spirits.</p>

<p>“Now tell us what’s the rest of this secret,”
demanded Fred. “Where are we bound?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell them, girls,” cried Tom Rover.
“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he went on, with that
same merry twinkle in his eyes. “I’ll give a five-dollar
bill to the boy who first guesses where we
are going to stop to-night. Now, no more questions,
only keep your eyes wide open.”</p>

<p>“Well, so far, for all I know, we may be headed
for New York City,” was Fred’s comment.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we may be headed for the north
pole,” answered his fun-loving uncle, gayly.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after supper, the automobile
trip was resumed. Mile after mile was reeled
off in the semi-darkness, the powerful lights of
both machines making the road almost as bright
as day. Travel seemed to be light on the highway,
and they made rapid progress for thirty
miles or more.</p>

<p>“Hello, here is a brand new concrete road!”
exclaimed Fred presently. “Looks as if it had
just been opened.”</p>

<p>“Opened less than a week ago,” answered his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
uncle. “Now watch sharp if you want to win
that prize.”</p>

<p>On and on sped the two automobiles. Seven
miles more were covered, and then they turned
sharply to the left and mounted a long hill thickly
wooded on either side. At the top of the hill
both automobiles came to a stop.</p>

<p>“Why, I declare!” stammered Fred. “It’s
Dexter’s Corners! There is the Swift River and
there’s the railroad station at Oak Run! Why,
we’re going to Valley Brook Farm!”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” sang out his uncle. And then he
tooted the horn three times. At the same time
the horn from the other automobile sounded out.</p>

<p>“Hello, they’ve discovered it too!” burst out
Mary.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Valley Brook Farm!” shouted
Randy.</p>

<p>“What do you know about this?” came from
the other automobile, in Jack’s voice. “Some surprise,
eh? We’re going to have our Thanksgiving
turkey on the farm.” And then he added
quickly: “Will father and mother be there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re coming up on the early morning
train to-morrow,” answered his Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>In a minute more they had passed across the
river in the direction of Dexter’s Corners. Then
they struck the old road leading to the farm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
where great-uncle Randolph and great-aunt
Martha resided, and where Dick, Tom and Sam
had spent so much time when their father, Anderson
Rover, had been lost in the jungles of Africa.</p>

<p>“My, but the old place certainly looks good to
me!” cried Jack, as they rolled up, both machines
sounding their horns loudly.</p>

<p>The old farmhouse was glowing with lights,
and now the front door opened, revealing Anderson
Rover and Randolph Rover and his wife
Martha. Then a side door opened likewise, and
to the front came rushing Jack Ness, the old hired
man, and Aleck Pop, the colored man who had
been the Rovers’ servant for so many years.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Valley Brook Farm!” shouted
Randy, as he rushed forward to embrace his Aunt
Martha, and the other boys echoed the cry.</p>

<small>A THANKSGIVING REUNION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“How good it seems to be at the farm once
more,” remarked Fred, after the various greetings
were over and old Aunt Martha had bustled off to
get a bit of lunch for the travelers before they
retired for the night.</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful old place,” said Ruth to Jack.
“I know I’m going to have a splendid time here.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad I can’t be with you, Ruth,” returned
the young major, rather wistfully. “But
you know the old saying—a fellow can’t be in
two places at once.”</p>

<p>“I only hope that motor-boat trip proves a
pleasant one, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think it will be a dandy. Ralph Mason,
you know, is a fine fellow, and he said the motor
boat was a peach.”</p>

<p>All the young folks were tired out because of
the various doings of the day, and were glad
enough to retire as soon as they had partaken of
the refreshments served. The boys slept soundly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and so did the girls, and none of them put in an
appearance until it was time for breakfast.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack!” cried Randy, as he met the hired
man on the side porch. “How are you feeling
these days?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good, everything considered,” answered
Jack Ness, with a grin. “Ain’t quite as
young as I used to be when your dad was a boy
around here.”</p>

<p>“He tells me you used to have great times
together.”</p>

<p>“Well, we did—when your dad and your
uncles didn’t get to cuttin’ up too high.”</p>

<p>“So they cut up once in a while, did they?”</p>

<p>“They sure did!”</p>

<p>After breakfast Tom Rover drove over to the
railroad station to meet Dick and his wife. Jack
and his sister went along, while Mary took Ruth
to show her over the place.</p>

<p>“Well, Aleck, you’re getting younger every
day,” remarked Andy, gayly, as he met the old
colored man bringing in some onions and turnips
from the barn.</p>

<p>“Can’t say as I’s much younger, but I ce’tainly
doan feel no older, Massa Andy,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Haven’t had the mumps, have you?” went on
Andy, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“Mumps? No, sah, I ain’t had no mumps.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe it was the measles?”</p>

<p>“No, sah, Massa Andy, I ain’t had no measles
either.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer. Perhaps it was chilblains, or
lumbago, or turtle-foot?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t had no chilblains nor no lumbago.
But w’at’s dat turtle-foot? I ain’t never done
hear of him.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of turtle-foot?” demanded the
fun-loving Rover boy. “Now isn’t that strange!
I thought you were brought up in a place where
everybody had turtle-foot once in a while. Your
nose looks just as if you’d had it. And just look
at your ears! They’re all curled up like dead
leaves. Don’t feel as if you wanted to see a
doctor or an undertaker, do you, Aleck?”</p>

<p>“Say, w’at you want to do? Scare dis nigger
out of his life?” questioned Aleck, his eyes
as big as saucers. “I doan feel nothin’ the
matter with my ears,” and he felt of both ears
carefully. “An’ my nose seems all right, too,” he
went on.</p>

<p>“All right. I only wanted to know. We can’t
afford to have anything happen to the best looking
colored man on the farm,” returned Andy,
with great seriousness.</p>

<p>“Say, you’re only jokin’, Massa Andy. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
is jest like your dad before you. He was always
botherin’ the life out o’ dis coon. But he was a
nice boy—yes, sah, he was. An’ he’s a nice man,
too,” added Aleck, hastily.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Aleck. I brought you a sure
cure for your ills,” continued the fun-loving
Rover. “Picked it up at a store in Haven Point
a few days ago. It will cure you of turtle-foot,
rheumatism, misery, or anything else. Whenever
you’re not feeling in the best of condition, just
smell it real hard, and you’ll feel better at once,”
and thus talking, Andy brought from his pocket
a small article wrapped in tissue paper.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Massa Andy, dat’s right good of
you to remember dis ol’ nigger,” answered Aleck,
taking the package. “Want me to look at it right
now?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Aleck. And remember, if you don’t
feel in the best of health just smell of it good and
strong.”</p>

<p>Setting down his basket of turnips and onions,
the colored man unwrapped the article somewhat
gingerly. To his gaze there was displayed an
imitation rabbit’s foot that looked almost real.</p>

<p>“A rabbit’s foot! Dat sure am good luck!” he
exclaimed, his eyes glistening. “Ain’t nothin’
better.” He turned the article over in his hands.
“I ain’t feelin’ so very scrumptuous this mornin’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
so maybe I’d better take a smell of it,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Sure, Aleck. But remember, you have to
smell good and powerful. Otherwise the charm
won’t work,” returned Andy.</p>

<p>Aleck looked at the imitation rabbit’s foot
again, and then lifted the article to his nostrils.
He closed his mouth tightly and took a long, deep
breath through his nose. The next instant the
colored man jerked back his head and his eyes
stared as if about to start from his face. Then
his head went back and he gave a resounding
sneeze.</p>

<p>Kerchoo! kerchoo! kerchoo! Loud and clear
came one sneeze after another while the tears
began to run down Aleck’s face.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, it’s taking effect!” shouted Andy,
gayly.</p>

<p>“Dat dere rabbit’s foot am—kerchoo—am full
of—kerchoo—pepper!” gasped Aleck Pop. “You
done—kerchoo—played a—kerchoo—trick on de
ol’ man!” And then he went off into another
spasm of sneezing.</p>

<p>“That will make you feel like a new man,
sure,” put in Randy, who stood near by watching
proceedings. Andy had told him about the rabbit’s
foot and what fun he hoped to have with
the article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“It certainly will clear out your head, Aleck,”
was Fred’s comment, with a grin. “Keep right
on sneezing.”</p>

<p>“Am dat a cure, or am it only ’nother trick?”
demanded Aleck, between more sneezes.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to take it for what it’s worth,
Aleck,” replied Andy, with a chuckle. “If you
don’t like it, you know you can always pass it
along.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Jack Ness would like to try the cure,”
suggested Randy.</p>

<p>“By golly, dat’s w’at I’ll do! I’ll try it on
Ness.” And then Aleck Pop pocketed the imitation
rabbit’s foot so well seasoned with cayenne
pepper and resumed his errand.</p>

<p>The train came in promptly, and it goes without
saying that Jack and Martha were glad to see
their father and mother. Dick Rover looked the
picture of health, and his wife Dora was as beautiful
as ever.</p>

<p>“We’re sure going to have some family reunion,”
remarked Jack, as they rode back to the
farm. “Everybody will be on hand to eat the
two turkeys Aunt Martha is having roasted.”</p>

<p>“And you just ought to see the pumpkin and
other pies in the pantry!” came from Martha.
“I’m sure all the boys will eat themselves sick.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I don’t see you and Mary holding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
back on pie, or turkey either,” returned her
brother, quickly.</p>

<p>It certainly was a grand family reunion. The
dining table extended from one end of the dining
room through the folding doors of the sitting
room. At the head of the table sat Grandfather
Anderson Rover, with old Uncle Randolph and
his wife Martha beside him. Then came the
fathers and mothers of the Rover boys, and the
young folks occupied the other end of the table,
with Ruth, the only outside guest, sitting between
Martha and Jack. It was old Uncle Randolph
who asked the blessing, and it can truthfully be
said that all were thankful that they were together
and in the best of health.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what—a gathering like this is
something to be remembered,” remarked Dick
Rover.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Dick,” came from Dora, his
wife. “There is no telling how long these gatherings
can last. Your father and your Aunt
Martha and Uncle Randolph are certainly growing
old.”</p>

<p>It was a great feast, and all of the young folks
ate turkey and cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes
and turnips and boiled onions until they had
to desist in order to save room for the pies and
other dessert that followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, I feel like a stuffed alderman!” sighed
Randy, at last. “I couldn’t eat another mouthful
if I tried.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“If I tried to eat another piece of pie, I’d bust
off every button I’ve got,” was the way Andy
expressed himself.</p>

<p>“Suppose we take a walk?” suggested Jack.
“We need it.”</p>

<p>“I expect you want to work up an appetite for
supper,” said Mary, slyly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something, haven’t we?” her
cousin retorted.</p>

<p>All of the young folks were glad to get out into
the air again, and they ended by taking a long
walk back of the farm where the Rick Rack River
flowed. The lads had gone over this territory a
number of times, and Jack pointed out to Ruth
where his father and his uncles had had numerous
adventures in the past—adventures which have
been jotted down from time to time in the earlier
volumes of the First Series.</p>

<p>“I wish you were going along on that motor-boat
trip, Ruth,” remarked Jack, when the pair
were strolling along a little apart from the others.</p>

<p>“It would be nice if we were all going,” admitted
the girl. “But I guess the motor boat
would be pretty well crowded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; Ralph said she wouldn’t hold any more
than the crowd that is to go.”</p>

<p>“Of course you expect to be back in time for
school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll be back unless the unexpected happens.”</p>

<p>All arrangements had already been made, and
bright and early on the morning following
Thanksgiving the four Rover boys said good-bye
to their parents and the others and drove away to
the railroad station at Oak Run. Here they took
a train for the Junction, and there changed to an
express for Worcester.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Ralph will be waiting for us at
Woods Hole?” remarked Fred, while on the way.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>The boys had lunch on the train, and at
Worcester changed to another train which connected
at Middleboro for Woods Hole. The run
was rather a long one, with numerous stops, and
as a consequence they did not reach Woods Hole
until well toward evening.</p>

<p>“I see Ralph!” exclaimed Randy, as they
alighted from the train, and the next minute the
former major of the Colby Hall battalion was
striding up to the Rovers.</p>

<p>“I was afraid the train might be late,” remarked
Ralph, after shaking hands all around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“How’s the motor boat?” questioned Fred,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy. I’ve had a man go over her
carefully, so that she is in first-class condition.”</p>

<p>“What about Gif and Spouter?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“They’re coming a little later. Come ahead—I’ve
got accommodations for all hands.”</p>

<p>In less than half an hour the boys found themselves
located at an old-fashioned but comfortable
hotel overlooking the waters of Vineyard Sound.
Not far distant was the dock at which the <i>Fancy</i>,
as the motor boat was named, was tied up.</p>

<p>The Rover boys were washing up for supper
when Gif and Spouter arrived, having made the
trip to Woods Hole in an automobile run by Mr.
Garrison, who, however, had to proceed on his
way because of business.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, have the best time possible,” said
he, as he bade his son and the others farewell.
“And above all things, don’t get into any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be all right, Dad. Don’t worry,”
returned Gif; and a few minutes later the seven
boys were left to themselves.</p>

<p>All of the lads were in the best of spirits, and
it must be confessed that they were far from
quiet when discussing their plans for the outing
while in their rooms after supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll run from here over to Oak Bluffs on
Marthas Vineyard,” announced Ralph. “We can
stay there a day and run around to Edgartown
and stay there also, if we desire. Then we’ll run
straight over to Nantucket, where there is a splendid
harbor. After that we can run over to Chatham
and other places on Cape Cod.”</p>

<p>“Sounds mighty good,” said Randy.</p>

<p>The boys arranged many of the details of the
trip and then turned in to dream of the happy
times in store for them. But none of them
dreamed of the many perils ahead, nor of the
thrilling adventures through which they were to
pass.</p>

</div>


<p>“Hurrah for a life on the ocean wave!”
shouted Andy.</p>

<p>“A home on the rolling deep!” came from
Randy.</p>

<p>“If you fellows don’t all get seasick before you
get back,” interposed Gif, closing one eye suggestively.</p>

<p>“Seasick? Perish the thought!” cried Andy,
tragically. “This crowd never gets seasick.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say it’s some dandy day for starting a
trip,” put in Jack. “It’s as fine as if we’d had it
made to order.”</p>

<p>“What a beautiful harbor,” was Spouter’s
comment. “Isn’t it queer there aren’t more boats
around?”</p>

<p>“You must remember the season is a little
late,” answered Ralph. “During the summer
you’ll find boats galore around here.”</p>

<p>“What about a harbor at Marthas Vineyard?”
questioned Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Very fine. And another fine one at Nantucket,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>The boys had left Woods Hole half an hour
before and were now headed southeast for their
first stopping-point, which was to be at Oak
Bluffs on the island of Marthas Vineyard. The
<i>Fancy</i> rode well, riding the swells of the Sound
like a thing of life. The sun shone brightly,
there was scarcely any wind, and it was indeed a
perfect day for the start of the boys’ motor-boat
cruise.</p>

<p>The <i>Fancy</i> was a new purchase by Mr. Mason,
and a better equipped motor boat could scarcely
be imagined. The craft was about thirty-five feet
in length and just broad enough to be safe and
comfortable without sacrificing too much speed.
The cockpit boasted of an engine of the latest
design capable of a high degree of speed, weather
permitting. The boat boasted of a fairly good-sized
cabin, all of the windows of which could be
raised or lowered as desired. The craft was
finished in oak and all of the fittings were of
brass, now polished to the highest degree. Ralph
had always been a neat boy, a stickler for order,
and this had obtained for him the position of
major of the school battalion, and his neatness
and orderliness were now reflected in the appearance
of the craft he commanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to take the wheel for a
while?” questioned Jack, who had been itching to
run the motor boat.</p>

<p>“Sure, you can take the wheel,” responded
Ralph, readily. “I’ll take a squint at the engine.
A new engine like that always needs looking over,
you know, until it works down to a bearing.”</p>

<p>As space on the <i>Fancy</i> was somewhat limited,
due to the fact that the boys had rigged up berths
in the cabin in case they wished to sleep on the
craft, they had brought along only such luggage
as seemed absolutely necessary. Their things
were soon stowed away, and then they gave themselves
up to the enjoyment of the occasion.</p>

<p>“Beats being in school all hollow,” declared
Andy, as they sped along on their course, the engine
humming merrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention school,” returned his twin.
“We’ll get enough of that when we get back.”</p>

<p>“What boat is that?” questioned Spouter, as he
pointed to a large craft not far distant.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the lightships around here,”
replied Ralph. “There are a number of them
strung along between here and Nantucket.”</p>

<p>“Rather a lonely life, staying on a ship like
that,” remarked Spouter. “I wonder how often
they get ashore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t as lonely as it might be farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
away,” answered Ralph. “I wish I had thought
of it before—I’d have brought them some newspapers.
Very often those going by throw newspapers
aboard a lightship, for which the light men
are very thankful.”</p>

<p>They had made out the island of Marthas
Vineyard ahead of them, and it was not long
before they approached one of the headlands
known as West Chop.</p>

<p>“The other headland over to our left is East
Chop,” explained Ralph. “And just beyond that
is the town of Oak Bluffs. Between the two
Chops is Vineyard Haven harbor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any oak bluffs,” commented
Spouter, who had a keen eye for scenery and
was watching the shoreline closely.</p>

<p>“I believe somebody said the oak bluffs were
swept into the water long ago by a storm,” answered
Ralph. “However, the town of Oak
Bluffs is quite a nice one, and the place has a
number of good summer hotels.”</p>

<p>The run into Vineyard Haven harbor did not
take long, and soon the boys made a landing and
went ashore. It was now close to noon.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad it’s so late in the season,” remarked
Ralph, as they were riding along in a
jitney they hired. “Nearly all of the summer
hotels at Oak Bluffs are closed. But I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
we’ll find fair accommodations somewhere in the
town.”</p>

<p>They interviewed the jitney driver, who seemed
to be a native of the island, and were directed by
him to the only large hotel that was open. There
the lads decided to remain for the night, taking
the afternoon off to explore the place.</p>

<p>“Certainly a pretty resort,” announced Spouter,
after dinner and while they were riding around
the town.</p>

<p>They found a splendid road along the shore
leading to Edgartown and were told there was
another fine highway to the westward which ran
through Vineyard Haven to Indian Hill and Gay
Head.</p>

<p>“You certainly ought to visit Gay Head,” said
the jitney driver. “It’s only about twenty miles
from here and a splendid drive, and Gay Head is
well worth looking at. You’ll find some of the
old Marthas Vineyard Indians down there, too,
selling trinkets.”</p>

<p>The boys talked it over, and decided that they
would have the driver take them to Gay Head and
were soon on the way. After passing through
Vineyard Haven they struck out through the
country in the direction of Indian Hill, and then
passed on through the woods and beyond numerous
farms until they came out on a high headland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
close to which was located a government
lighthouse.</p>

<p>Gay Head proved to be a series of headlands
consisting for the most part of clay of various
colors. As the setting sun played upon this
kaleidoscope of color, Spouter went into ecstasies.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it magnificent!” he cried. “Just look at
the wonderful combinations of coloring—red,
blue, green, brown, and a hundred and one
shades! I never dreamed they had anything like
this!”</p>

<p>Nearly all the boys took the path leading down
from the top of Gay Head to the beach far below.
But Andy and Randy, more venturesome, decided
to find a way of their own.</p>

<p>“Be careful, there!” sang out Fred. “That
stuff is awfully slippery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re all right,” responded Randy.
“Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>He and his twin brother were walking along
one of the larger of the headlands. There was a
shelf a few feet below, and both attempted to
scramble to this. But as Fred had said, the vari-colored
clay was exceedingly slippery, and almost
before they knew it the twins had gone flat on
their backs. Randy clutched at Andy, and both
did their best to keep from slipping farther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Dig in! Dig in!” gasped Andy, clutching
vainly at the slippery clay beneath him.</p>

<p>“Dig in, yourself,” spluttered his twin.</p>

<p>He clutched at a slight projection, but the clay
came away in his hand, and down he rolled over
and over with his brother close behind him. They
reached another ledge of clay, which broke beneath
their sudden weight, and then on and on
they went, bringing up at last in a mass of soft
clay but a few yards from the sand that lined the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t the dog’s false teeth!”
gasped Andy, when he could speak. “We came
down in a hurry, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“And we saved a lot of time, I’ll say,” murmured
Randy. Then he held up his hands.
“Just look at these paws, will you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the paws,” retorted his brother,
and then began to grin. “Look at your clothing,
will you? It’s all the colors of the rainbow.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Look at yourself. You look as if
you’d been sleeping on a painter’s palette.”</p>

<p>The two boys arose and brushed themselves
off as well as they were able. Then they limped
down to the water’s edge, where they washed
their faces and hands. By this time the others
had come down by way of the regular trail and
joined them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Anybody hurt?” questioned Jack, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nothing hurt but our feelings,” grumbled
Randy.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to have those suits cleaned and
pressed, I’m thinking,” remarked Gif. “If you
don’t do it, folks will take you for a couple of
tramps.” And then he had to laugh, and everybody
joined in, even the twins taking the mishap
in good part.</p>

<p>After inspecting Gay Head, the lads visited the
lighthouse, bought a few trinkets from some
Indian children who had the things on sale, and
then returned to Oak Bluffs. Here a tailor was
found who promised to clean and press the damaged
suits before morning.</p>

<p>The following day found the Rover boys and
their chums once more aboard the motor boat.
The gasoline tank had been filled, and soon they
were on their way past Oak Bluffs to the harbor
at Edgartown.</p>

<p>“It would be fine to spend a vacation here in
the summer time,” remarked Jack, as they sped
along.</p>

<p>“Look at that big hotel just facing us,” put in
Fred. “I wouldn’t mind stopping there. A fellow
wouldn’t have to go very far to go in bathing,”
he continued, pointing to a long row of
bathhouses almost in front of the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“Why don’t you jump in now and have a bath,
Fred?” said Andy, grinning.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Andy. I’m afraid the water
would be a trifle warm,” responded the youngest
Rover boy.</p>

<p>At Edgartown, much to their surprise, the boys
ran into several of their school chums, including
Dan Soppinger, Ned Lowe and Will Hendry,
always called Fatty, because of his unusual stoutness.</p>

<p>“Well, look who’s here!” cried Dan Soppinger.</p>

<p>“What brought you?” came from Fatty Hendry.
“Did you run over here to take us back
home?”</p>

<p>“No. We came over to hear Ned sing and
play,” answered Randy, and this brought on a
general smile, for Ned Lowe was well known for
his manipulation of a mandolin and his propensity
for singing funny songs.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about your running out to Nantucket,”
remarked Dan Soppinger, after he had
heard the plans of the others. “They’ve been
having a lot of fog around here lately. You
don’t want to get lost in a fog.”</p>

<p>“Now, Dan, don’t be a wet blanket!” cried
Fred. “Who ever heard of fog in weather like
this! Why, it’s just perfect!”</p>

<p>“At the same time, you can’t tell about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
weather around here,” broke in Fatty Hendry.
“I’ve known it to change completely in a few
hours. You had better be careful, and if you see
any signs of bad weather you had better put into
the nearest harbor.”</p>

<p>All of the boys remained at Edgartown over
night and then the trip on the <i>Fancy</i> was continued,
the motor boat now heading for the town
of Nantucket, located on the island of the same
name.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll be getting out on the Atlantic
Ocean,” remarked Randy, as mile after mile was
covered on the course eastward and when they
had passed another lightship.</p>

<p>“They call this Nantucket Sound,” answered
Ralph. “But it’s all so open that you can hardly
tell where the Sound ends and the ocean begins.”</p>

<p>As Ralph was not acquainted with the course,
they did not arrive at Nantucket harbor until well
toward evening. The day, however, had proved
ideal, and every one enjoyed the trip to the utmost.
In the harbor of the quaint old town,
which in years gone by was devoted almost exclusively
to the whaling industry, they found a
great number of craft of all kinds.</p>

<p>“There are some storm warnings up,” announced
Ralph presently. “But I must confess
that I don’t see anything of a storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“Nor do I,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>They spent the evening in roaming around the
quaint old town with its wide cobblestone main
street and its narrow alleyways with their
weather-beaten homes. They even took an automobile
ride extending across the island to ’Sconset,
a small colony located directly facing the
broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Gosh! here’s where a fellow can stand and
look right over to Europe,” announced Fred.</p>

<p>“You can if you have good eyesight,” chuckled
Randy.</p>

<p>In the morning the storm signals were still displayed,
but the Rovers and their chums could see
no evidences of anything unusual brewing. There
was little or no breeze, and the sun shone brightly.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you fellows want to do?”
questioned Ralph, after they had breakfasted
and were walking toward where the motor boat
was tied up.</p>

<p>“I’d just as lief go on,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>“So would I,” put in Gif. “We’ve seen about
all there is to see around here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and remember this vacation isn’t going
to last forever,” came from Randy. “Before we
know it, we’ll have to be back at Colby Hall
again.”</p>

<p>All the boys were eager to continue the trip,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and after seeing to the supply of gasoline and oil
they had the hotel keeper pack up a generous
lunch for them and then set off.</p>

<p>“Hi, you fellows! Better beware!” called out
one old man, who looked as if he might have
been a sea captain. “We’re going to have some
bad weather before night.”</p>

<p>“We’ll watch out,” answered Ralph. “If we
see anything that looks mussy, we’ll head for a
harbor in a hurry.”</p>

<p>By studying the map, the boys had found that
Chatham on Cape Cod lay due north of the eastern
shore of Nantucket. It was not a great many
miles to this well known summer resort, and all
felt sure that they could make it without much
trouble.</p>

<p>“Seems to be hardly any swell on the water,”
declared Gif. “I thought it would be a good deal
rougher away out here.”</p>

<p>“I guess it gets rough enough in bad weather,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>The engine of the <i>Fancy</i> was running smoothly,
and soon they slipped out of Nantucket harbor
and the island gradually faded from sight.</p>

<p>“A pippin of a boat, and no mistake,” remarked
Spouter. “She rides the ocean like a
thing of life. Ralph, it was certainly fine of you
to offer this outing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“Better not say too much until we get back,”
answered Ralph. “The best of motor boats kick
up sometimes, you know.”</p>

<p>Ralph had scarcely spoken when the kick-up he
had mentioned happened. The engine seemed to
slow down, the cylinders missed fire one after
another, and then, of a sudden, the motor stopped.</p>

<p>“Now what’s the matter?” questioned Randy,
in dismay.</p>

<p>“That’s to be found out,” answered Ralph, and
his usually confident face showed his concern.</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope we haven’t broken down!” whispered
Fred to Randy. “We’re a good many miles
from shore.”</p>

<p>Eagerly Ralph looked over the engine, and so
did Jack and Gif.</p>

<p>“I think it’s the supply pipe,” announced Ralph
presently. “It acts to me as if it was clogged
up.”</p>

<p>“Dirty gasoline would do that,” answered Jack.
“I wouldn’t put it past some of these strange
fellows to sell you any old thing. They don’t
care as long as they get your money.”</p>

<p>He and Ralph worked over the supply pipe,
which was so tightly fastened on that it took their
combined strength to loosen it. The gasoline did
not run, and finally with the aid of a fine wire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
they managed to bring out of the pipe a small
quantity of waste filled with black dirt.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, you want to hurry up with those
repairs!” cried Andy, suddenly. “Just look at
those clouds coming up!”</p>

<p>All looked in the direction pointed out, and it
must be confessed that the hearts of the lads sank
when they saw what was overtaking them. The
clouds were obscuring the sun, and, almost before
they could realize it, a heavy bank of fog rolled
down, enveloping them completely.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<small>LOST IN THE FOG</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Having cleared out the supply pipe as well as
they were able, Jack and Ralph adjusted the
same. Then the motor was started and after
considerable spluttering the engine seemed to
work almost as well as ever.</p>

<p>But all this had taken time, and now the sun
was hidden completely, and the fog had settled
down upon them like a gigantic blanket, shutting
off the view in all directions.</p>

<p>“They had it right when they put up those
storm signals,” was Fred’s dubious comment.
“Gee! did you ever see fog come in such a
hurry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and just notice how wet and cold it is,
too,” added Randy, shivering. “I’ll bet the thermometer
has gone down twenty degrees.”</p>

<p>“We might as well put on our slickers,” suggested
Jack, for they had provided themselves
with raincoats for the trip.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll have to steer by the compass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
entirely,” said Ralph. “Which way shall we head—back
to Nantucket or for Chatham?”</p>

<p>“Which do you think is nearest?” questioned
Gif.</p>

<p>“I think we’re about half way, Gif.”</p>

<p>“In that case, we might as well go on,” put in
Spouter. “We don’t want to be tied up at Nantucket
indefinitely. If we reach Chatham, or
some other point on the Cape, then, if the weather
continues to be bad, we can always get back by
train.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we don’t want to leave Ralph alone
with the boat,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be all right,” answered the
former major of the school battalion. “I haven’t
got to get back, you know. My time is my own.
I can stay anywhere until the weather clears up,
and then it will be an easy matter for me to run
along the coast to New Bedford, where we keep
the <i>Fancy</i>.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to run slow, Ralph, and toot your
horn,” said Randy. “We don’t want to smash
into anything.”</p>

<p>“Every one of you had better keep his eyes and
ears wide open. We’re right in the course used
by a whole lot of steamers going up and down
the coast. If one of those big vessels hits us it
might cut us in two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Wow! but you’re a cheerful customer,” murmured
Andy. “You’ll have us at the bottom of
the ocean before you know it.”</p>

<p>But in spite of this raillery, Andy knew as well
as the others that there was need for caution.
Two of the lads stationed themselves in the bow
of the motor boat, and as they proceeded the horn
of which the craft boasted was sounded frequently.</p>

<p>Not daring to take too many chances, the
<i>Fancy</i> was run at half speed. Thus they had
covered about a mile when they heard a hoarse
whistle coming from a distance.</p>

<p>“There is one of the big steamers now!” cried
Gif.</p>

<p>“I hope she isn’t headed our way,” put in
Spouter, quickly.</p>

<p>The boys continued to toot the horn of the
motor boat, and listened intently to the deep tone
coming from the unknown. Slowly but surely
the warning through the fog kept coming closer
and closer.</p>

<p>“My gracious! she’s coming this way as sure
as fate,” burst out Fred. “Toot that horn for
all you’re worth!”</p>

<p>“Let’s yell,” suggested Randy, and all of the
boys yelled with might and main, making as much
noise as they had ever made in their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea!” cried Andy, presently, and
dashed into the cabin. He reappeared with a tin
pan and a big spoon. At once he began to beat
on the pan as hard as he could.</p>

<p>It was a time of intense anxiety. Although
they strained their eyes to the utmost, none of
the lads could pierce the blanket of fog which
hung thickly on every side. They turned on the
searchlight, but even this revealed nothing but the
murky water just ahead of them.</p>

<p>And in that dense fog the hoarse notes from
the steamer were highly deceptive. First the
boys thought they came from the right, then from
the left, and then they were certain they were
dead ahead. Their nerves were tense, and every
second seemed like an hour. And slowly but
surely the warning whistle came closer and
closer.</p>

<p>“Maybe you had better back her, Ralph,” suggested
Jack, and at once the engine was started
up again and set in reverse.</p>

<p>“There she is! On our right!” called out
Randy, a moment later.</p>

<p>“She’s heading this way!” screamed Fred.</p>

<p>“Back her, Ralph! Back her, or we’ll be cut
in two!” bellowed Gif.</p>

<p>Like a great ghost the bow of the steamer shone
forth in the rays of the motor-boat searchlight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
There was a clanging of bells, and the big steamer
veered off while the <i>Fancy</i> continued to back. As
the stern of the large vessel swept within twenty
feet of the smaller craft, the boys caught sight
of many passengers and some officers peering
anxiously over the rail at them. Then the big
steamer was swallowed up again in the fog and
the motor boat and its occupants were left to
themselves.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that all of the cadets had
been scared, and with good reason. Now that
the peril was over, each felt a sinking sensation,
and Fred and Spouter were close to fainting. It
was several seconds before any one felt like
speaking.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing you backed, Ralph,” said
Gif, soberly. “If you hadn’t done it we might
have been cut in two.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got Jack to thank for that,” answered
the young commander of the <i>Fancy</i>. “It certainly
was a close shave, wasn’t it?” he added,
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not yet out of our troubles,”
came from Randy. “Where there is one boat
like that there’s apt to be more. I think we had
better head for the Cape as quickly as we can
make it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t afford to run fast,” broke in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Fred. “The best thing to do is to run as cautiously
as possible.”</p>

<p>“I’d give as much as ten dollars to be on land
again,” murmured Spouter. “We were fools not
to heed those storm warnings.”</p>

<p>So far there had been no rain. But now a miserable
drizzle set in, as cold as it was dismal.
The boys buttoned up their slickers tightly and
pulled their caps well down over their faces. But
with it all they felt far from comfortable and
could not keep from shivering.</p>

<p>“Might as well have a bite to eat,” suggested
Andy, after another hour had passed and they
were still in the midst of the cold drizzle and fog.
“Maybe it will warm us up.”</p>

<p>The lunch was passed around, and although
some of the boys did not have much of an appetite,
the food disappeared quite rapidly. With
the lunch they had brought along a thermos
bottle filled with hot coffee, and this beverage
was comforting.</p>

<p>Presently the wind began to blow and the boys
had hopes that this would dispel the fog. But
they speedily found out their mistake. Once or
twice they saw a bit of clearing, but then the
wind died down and the fog seemed to become
thicker than ever, the glass of the cabin windows
running with water inside and out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“A fellow doesn’t realize what sunshine means
until it fails him,” was Spouter’s comment.
“Gosh! how good it would seem if the sun came
out as bright as it was yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is one thing to be thankful for,”
said Jack, trying to be cheerful. “So far as I can
see, this boat doesn’t leak a drop.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t expect a brand new boat to
leak, would you?” asked Gif.</p>

<p>“Some boats might—if they had been kept dry
too long,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we need worry about the <i>Fancy</i>
leaking,” came from Ralph. “And I don’t think
we’ll have any serious trouble with the engine—although,
of course, we may have some if that
gasoline is too dirty. After this I’m going to
have every gallon I buy strained before it is put
in.”</p>

<p>Another half hour passed, and again they
heard the hoarse whistle of a steamer, this time
from their left.</p>

<p>“She’s coming up the coast, but she doesn’t
seem to be very close,” said Andy. “Gosh! I hope
she passes by without scaring the wits out of us,”
he added, with a wry smile.</p>

<p>As before, the cadets strained their ears. The
sounds kept coming closer, but presently they
died away in the distance, much to the lads’ relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Ralph had stopped the engine, but now it was
started once more, and again they headed in the
direction of Cape Cod, steering, of course, entirely
by the compass.</p>

<p>“I’m heading a little to the westward,” announced
Ralph. “I don’t want to miss the shore
of the Cape and get out into the Atlantic by
mistake.”</p>

<p>Less than twenty minutes later they found
themselves in more trouble. Again the engine
stopped, and once more Ralph and Jack, aided by
Gif, began a search for the trouble. They found
the supply pipe flowing freely, and then examined
the carburetor, and finally looked over the wiring.</p>

<p>“I think it’s in the battery,” said Jack, at last,
and when the sparking was tested this proved to
be a fact.</p>

<p>The <i>Fancy</i> was equipped with a full set of
tools, but, even so, the boys made a long job of
getting the motor to run. In the meanwhile, the
wind had sprung up again, and they found themselves
drifting eastward into the broad and rolling
Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Gee, this looks as if we might never get
back!” whispered Fred to Randy.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Fred, or you’ll have us all
scared to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be half so bad if we could only see
where we are,” put in Andy.</p>

<p>“It would be a great deal better if the fog
would lift,” came from Jack. “Then, if we
couldn’t get going, we might hoist some sort of
signal of distress.”</p>

<p>The wind now came in irregular puffs, and,
having lost her headway, the <i>Fancy</i> rolled dreadfully
and occasionally shipped considerable water.
Several of the boys began to bale the craft while
the others continued to work over the battery.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! She’s going!” announced Jack, at
last, and all felt something of relief when the
engine was again running. Then the craft was
turned around and headed once more in the direction
of Cape Cod.</p>

<p>With the wind came a regular downpour of
rain, yet even this did not serve to dispel the fog
entirely. Try their best, none of the boys could
see more than four or five yards in any direction.
They continued to sound their horn and occasionally
use the flashlight.</p>

<p>“We ought to be pretty close to the Cape,” said
Jack, as they moved along cautiously.</p>

<p>“That depends,” answered Ralph. “We may
have drifted out into the ocean a long distance
while we were making repairs.”</p>

<p>“We are certainly having our share of hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
luck,” was Gif’s comment. “But, never mind, I
guess we’ll be out of it in an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“We can’t get out any too quickly for me,”
muttered Spouter, who cared for the water less
than any of the others.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fred uttered a cry which was taken
up by the twins. All had seen something ahead
on their left.</p>

<p>“Looked like a small boat to me,” declared the
youngest Rover.</p>

<p>“It was a boat! A motor craft something like
this one!” declared Randy.</p>

<p>“And it was loaded with boxes,” put in his
twin.</p>

<p>“Why in the name of common sense didn’t
they toot a horn, or something?” burst out Ralph.
“We might have run right into them!”</p>

<p>“Did you say she was loaded with boxes?”
questioned Jack, of his cousin.</p>

<p>“She sure was, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe she didn’t want to be seen,” answered
the young major, grimly. “Those boxes
may have been filled with liquor taken from some
rum ship standing off the coast. I saw in a newspaper
only last week that the rum ships were
standing off the coast all the way from Maine to
Florida. All they have to do is to keep outside
of the legal limit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>At the alarm given by Fred, Ralph had stopped
the engine again. But now the trip was once
more resumed.</p>

<p>“If that was a boat carrying liquor from some
rum-runner to the shore, perhaps the big vessel
isn’t far off,” remarked Jack, a few minutes later.</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left his lips when all on
board the motor boat saw that something unusual
was going on just ahead of them. Before
Ralph could slow down, the <i>Fancy</i> plowed her
way between several small boats, and then struck
a glancing blow on the bow of a large three-masted
schooner.</p>

<p>“Hi! what are you doing there?” came in a
bellowing tone from out of the rain and fog.</p>

<p>“It’s a government boat!”</p>

<p>“They’re spying on us!”</p>

<p>“Jump them, boys! Don’t let ’em get away!”</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries uttered by those
aboard the strange boats.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Ralph had shut off the engine,
but the shock of the collision had thrown
most of the lads off their feet. Then, before the
lads could recover, the <i>Fancy</i> was boarded by half
a dozen burly men.</p>

<small>ABOARD THE SCHOONER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“Are you government spies?”</p>

<p>“They look pretty young for spies,” announced
one of the men, as he faced Jack.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by slamming into our
boats in this fashion?” roared one elderly fellow,
a man with an ugly scar on his jaw. “Do you
want to send us all to Davy Jones’ Locker?”</p>

<p>“Better search ’em, Jim. They may be heeled,”
muttered another.</p>

<p>“Here, what do you fellows want?” demanded
Ralph.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Do you own this boat?” questioned
the man with a scar.</p>

<p>“It belongs to my father.”</p>

<p>“Where are you from—Hyannis?” asked
another of the fellows, quickly.</p>

<p>“Up with your hands, all of you!” commanded
the first man who had spoken.</p>

<p>As several of the men were armed, the boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
felt that it would be useless to resist, so they allowed
themselves to be searched. Then one of the
men went into the cabin and found a pistol which
belonged to Ralph. Of course, the Rovers and
their chums were very angry; but they saw that
they had an exceedingly rough crowd to deal with—men
who would go to any length to have their
own way—so they felt that it would be useless to
resist.</p>

<p>“Carrying any loose change with you, Buddy?”
questioned one of the men, leering into Randy’s
face and then glancing down at his watch-chain.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” answered Randy. “If
I’ve got any money I’m not going to give it to
you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that, Buddy. What are
you fellows doing out here, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I think they’re too young to be spies,” said
one of the men, who seemed to be a trifle more
respectable than his companions.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be too sure of that, Ike,” was the
reply from the man with the scar. “The government
is getting all sorts of people to watch us
lately. They’ve even got some women folks on
our trail.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they’re spies, we caught ’em nicely,”
came from another of the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“We are not spies, and we want you to let us
alone,” said Jack. “We were trying to find our
way from Nantucket to Chatham, and we hit you
by mistake. It wouldn’t have happened if you
had had a horn blowing. We sounded our own
horn every once in a while.”</p>

<p>“Never heard no horn,” declared one of the
men. “You can’t put up a job on us! I know
your sort! We ought to throw the whole bunch
of you overboard!”</p>

<p>It was easy to see that all of the men had been
drinking and that several of them were in anything
but an amiable mood. There were three
small boats and each of them was piled high with
boxes of liquor of various brands. Evidently the
boxes had come from the three-masted schooner,
for the larger vessel rode high and appeared to be
empty.</p>

<p>A war of words followed, lasting ten minutes
or more. In vain the Rover boys and their chums
pleaded that their coming upon the rum-runners
had been an accident. One or two of the men
seemed willing to believe them, but the majority
of the law-breakers were of the opinion that they
were spies.</p>

<p>“I’ve spotted a motor boat following us two
different nights,” said one of the men. “I’ll bet a
new hat this is the same boat. They thought they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
would spot us with our cargoes and hand us over
to the federal agents.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t true! Not a word of it!” said Ralph.</p>

<p>“We want you to let us go. Otherwise you’re
going to get yourselves into a lot of trouble,” put
in Gif.</p>

<p>These words seemed only to anger the men.
They conferred among themselves, and then one
of them, the fellow with the scar, came to Ralph.</p>

<p>“You go up on the schooner and talk to Captain
Gilsen,” said he. “He’s the fellow to settle
this.”</p>

<p>“And the rest of you go up with him,” put in
another. “He’ll probably want to talk to every
one of you before he lets you go.”</p>

<p>Somewhat against their will, one after another
of <a href="#i_fp066">the boys was hustled up</a> a rope ladder that
hung over <a href="#i_fp066">the side of the schooner</a>.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“What of the motor boat? Who is going to
take care of that?” questioned Jack, as he
went up.</p>

<p>“We’ll look after the motor boat,” answered
the scar-faced man.</p>

<p>Once on the deck of the schooner, Ralph and
the others found themselves confronted by a
burly, dark-faced fellow with a fierce moustache.
This was Captain Gilsen.</p>

<p>“Now, I want the straight of this,” the captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
said harshly. “No crooked story for me, understand!”</p>

<p>“We’re telling you the simple truth, Captain,”
said Ralph, and then he and Jack and Gif told
their story.</p>

<p>“Humph! Maybe that’s true and maybe it
isn’t,” muttered the captain, tugging at his moustache.
“For all I know, if I let you go, as soon as
you get ashore you’ll get my friends into trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll get into trouble if you don’t let us
go,” answered Jack pointedly. “You have no
right to detain us.”</p>

<p>“And you have no right to come up and bump
into my schooner,” growled the captain. “For all
I know, you’ve done a whole lot of damage.”</p>

<p>“No damage at all outside of a little paint being
scraped off,” put in Gif. “And it was a pure
accident. If you had had your horn blowing, it
wouldn’t have happened.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell me what I ought to be doing,”
stormed Captain Gilsen. “I was running a ship
before you were born. You stay right here until
I talk it over with the other men.”</p>

<p>While the captain was speaking another man
had come on deck, rubbing his eyes and stretching
himself as if he had been asleep. He looked at
the boys in surprise, and then, as his gaze fell
upon Jack, he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“What in thunder are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Jack looked at the fellow sharply and then he
was equally surprised. The newcomer was Bill
Ferguson, one of the two men who had been
pitched out of the overturned automobile.</p>

<p>“Do you know these fellows?” demanded Captain
Gilsen, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“I know this fellow,” was the surly answer.
“He’s the one I was telling you about—the fellow
who was riding in the automobile that almost
bumped into Billings and me.”</p>

<p>“What? The same kid? That certainly is
interesting!”</p>

<p>“How did he come here?”</p>

<p>“You must have slept mighty hard, Bill, or you
wouldn’t ask that question,” came from the captain
of the schooner. “The whole bunch
smashed into us with their motor boat. We
don’t know whether they are spies or what they
are.” And then the captain continued: “You
watch the bunch while I talk it over with the
other fellows. I want to be sure of what I’m
doing before I let them go.”</p>

<p>The captain walked to the side of the schooner
and then went down the rope ladder to one of the
small boats. Here he held an earnest conversation
with those who had first seen the boys.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t expect to see you quite so soon,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
remarked Bill Ferguson, with a leer at Jack. “I
ought to give you a sound lickin’, that’s what I
ought to do!”</p>

<p>“That accident was your own fault, and you
know it,” answered Jack, not knowing what else
to say. “You have no right to blame me for it.”</p>

<p>“Were you runnin’ the car?”</p>

<p>“No. My uncle was doing that.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, he’s the one, I suppose, I ought to
blame.”</p>

<p>“Not at all! It was your own fault.”</p>

<p>“Humph! How did you get here?”</p>

<p>Again the story was told, Bill Ferguson listening
with deep interest. He scowled sourly when
Jack finished. Then, of a sudden, a crafty look
came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Where is the motor boat now—tied fast to the
schooner?”</p>

<p>“Tied fast to one of the other boats,” put in
Ralph.</p>

<p>“Is your motor boat an old one?”</p>

<p>“No, she’s brand new,” answered the young
commander of the <i>Fancy</i>.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when he realized that he
had made a mistake. A new sea-going motor
boat is worth considerable money, and Ralph, as
well as Jack, felt that Ferguson must realize
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“You stay where you are. I’ll see what the
men have to say myself,” said Bill Ferguson, presently,
and strode to the rail.</p>

<p>The boys felt in anything but a comfortable
position. They were outnumbered at least three
to one, and all of the rum-runners seemed to be
armed. More than this, as they were on the high
seas, the captain of the schooner would be likely
to do about as he pleased.</p>

<p>“Say, Ralph, can’t we jump on the motor boat
somehow and get away?” whispered Gif.</p>

<p>“If we don’t get away, I’m thinking these fellows
will rob us,” came from Randy, who had
not forgotten what one of the rascals had said
about money.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we can get to the motor boat,”
was Ralph’s reply. “Do you think we can make
it, Jack?”</p>

<p>The young major shook his head. He felt that
it would not be safe to make the attempt in the
fog and with the motor boat bobbing up and
down on the swells of the ocean.</p>

<p>The conversation between Captain Gilsen and
the owners of the small boats lasted for the best
part of a quarter of an hour. Then, when the
captain came on deck again, he held another conference
with Bill Ferguson. Later on the Rover
boys learned that Ferguson and Gilsen were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
only cousins, but also partners in their illegal
traffic.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I can’t let you go just yet,”
said Captain Gilsen, when he came back to the
lads. “Some of the men are afraid that you are
spies and will get them into trouble. They want a
chance to get away first.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any right to detain us,” said
Ralph.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m taking the right. We’ll tie the
motor boat fast to the schooner, and then you can
just sit down and suck your thumbs for an hour
or two.”</p>

<p>“And you can thank your stars you’re gettin’
off so easy,” put in Bill Ferguson. “I ought to
give you a good lickin’, that’s what I ought to
do,” he went on to Jack.</p>

<p>The boys had noted that there were at least six
or eight sailors on board the <i>Hildegarde</i>, as the
schooner was named. For all they knew, these
men might also be armed, so it would be folly for
them to show any resistance. This being so, they
remained on the deck of the craft while one after
another of the smaller boats took their departure.
The <i>Fancy</i> was attached by a long cable to the
<i>Hildegarde</i> and was left in charge of one of the
sailors, who seemed to know how to manage such
a craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Now make yourselves at home on deck, but
don’t get into mischief,” said Captain Gilsen to
the boys, after the small boats were gone. “I’ve
got a few things to attend to below deck. I’ll be
up after a while and we can talk matters over.”</p>

<p>He and Ferguson went below and in the cabin
held a whispered conversation lasting quite a
while. In the meantime, the boys talked matters
over, trying to determine what would be best for
them to do.</p>

<p>“We are certainly in a pickle,” was the way
Spouter expressed himself. “Half of the men on
this boat look to be regular cutthroats.”</p>

<p>“They’re a bad bunch, you may be sure of
that,” answered Jack. “If they weren’t, they
wouldn’t be in any such business.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can’t haul the motor boat
closer, drop aboard, and get away,” suggested
Andy.</p>

<p>“We might jump overboard and swim for it,”
said his brother, “but it would be mighty cold.”</p>

<p>When Captain Gilsen showed himself again his
face wore rather a sickly smile.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I have to tell you this,” he said.
“But the fact of the matter is, we’re afraid to
trust you to go ashore just at present. We want
to give those other fellows a chance to dispose of
their cargo. If you went ashore, you might spoil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
everything. So we’ve concluded to take you
along with us until the weather clears off. Then
we’ll let you go.”</p>

<p>“You mean that we’ve got to go with you?”
cried Spouter, in dismay.</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“But suppose we don’t want to go with you?”
put in Gif.</p>

<p>At this Captain Gilsen drew himself up.</p>

<p>“You have to go,” he replied curtly. “This is
my ship, and what I say goes!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>A NIGHT OF ANXIETY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“You mean to tell us we’re prisoners?” demanded
Jack, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Not exactly prisoners,” returned Captain Gilsen.
“There is no use of getting so sour about
it. This whole happening is your own fault—not
ours. We didn’t invite you to come here
and spy on our doings.”</p>

<p>“How long do you want us to remain?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“That will depend on how you behave. If you
take things easy like, we’ll let you go just as soon
as the weather clears. No use of letting you go
now; you might bump into some of the rest of
our ships,” and again the captain of the <i>Hildegarde</i>
tugged at his heavy moustache.</p>

<p>“Well, all I’ve got to say is, this is a
mighty high-handed proceeding,” declared Ralph.
“However, you’ve got the best of us, and I suppose
we’ve got to submit. Just the same, I want
you to understand that we are protesting against
this whole proceeding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let ’em give you any guff,” put in
Bill Ferguson, who had followed Captain Gilsen
to the deck. “They know they’re in wrong just
as well as we do.”</p>

<p>“How long do you expect to remain in this
vicinity?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to remain at all, now we’ve
discharged our cargo,” answered the captain.</p>

<p>“You mean to say you are going to carry us
off?” cried Gif.</p>

<p>“We won’t carry you very far. We’re headed
down the coast, so when we let you go you’ll be
able to get ashore easy.”</p>

<p>A bitter war of words followed, all of the boys
insisting upon it that the captain of the <i>Hildegarde</i>
had no right to carry them off in this
fashion. Andy and Randy were strongly in favor
of fighting for their rights; but upon seeing
this both the captain and Ferguson showed their
pistols.</p>

<p>“You behave yourselves and act like gentlemen,
or else somebody is going to get hurt,”
warned the captain. “This is my ship, and I
won’t stand for any nonsense while you’re on
board. Now the whole bunch of you get forward,
and don’t let me hear another word out
of you until I let you go.”</p>

<p>Then, as the boys were forced to retreat in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
direction of the forecastle of the schooner, Captain
Gilsen called his mate, a fellow named Letts,
and told him to take charge of the newcomers.</p>

<p>“Watch ’em closely,” the captain ordered.
“Don’t give ’em a chance to arm themselves or
put up any kind of a job on us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ll attend to it,” answered Letts.
He was a short, stocky individual and anything
but prepossessing in appearance. Later, the boys
learned that he had once been a prize-fighter in
England.</p>

<p>A short time later, and while the Rover boys
and their chums were wondering what would
happen next, orders were given to hoist the sails
and start up the auxiliary engine, and soon the
<i>Hildegarde</i> was moving away through the fog.</p>

<p>“Which way are you heading?” questioned
Ralph, of the mate.</p>

<p>“Down the coast,” was the curt reply. “Now
don’t ask more questions. When the call comes
for mess, you can have your share with the men.
If you have to stay on board over night, I’ll
have them fix you up somehow in the fo’castle.”</p>

<p>The lads found the forecastle of the <i>Hildegarde</i>
anything but a clean and sweet-smelling
place, and so, after a brief survey, they were glad
to come out on deck again and seek such shelter
as they could find in the fresh air. All of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
hands on the rum-runner eyed them curiously,
but said little, having evidently been instructed
by Letts not to become communicative.</p>

<p>“Well, we are certainly in a pickle,” announced
Jack, dubiously. “I must confess I can’t see
any way out, either.”</p>

<p>“Nor can I,” came from Gif.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is, there is no telling how
long they’ll compel us to remain on board,” broke
in Fred.</p>

<p>“Gee! I wish we had our school rifles here,”
remarked Randy. “I think we could soon show
this bunch where they get off!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to put up a fight as well as any of
you,” said the young major. “But I’m satisfied
we would get the worst of it. You saw how the
captain and Ferguson drew their pistols at the
first sign of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and those rascals would use the pistols,
too!” was Spouter’s comment. “Both of those
skunks are about as hard-boiled as they make
’em.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the mate and the crew are just as
vile,” added Fred.</p>

<p>Not having access to the compass on the ship,
the boys had no means of knowing how the craft
was headed. The fog was as thick as ever, and
now the horn was kept sounding as the auxiliary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
engine drove the <i>Hildegarde</i> forward, the sails
doing little to aid the progress of the craft.</p>

<p>Presently four bells struck, and one of the
hands, a tall, lanky fellow who had been watching
the boys furtively, came to them and announced
that the evening mess was ready.</p>

<p>“You ain’t goin’ to git nothin’ like you’d git
at that Astoria-Vanderbilt Hotel in New York,”
he announced, his little eyes twinkling good-naturedly.
“They don’t serve no table de hotie
bill of fare on this schooner. You’ve got
to have a cast-iron stomach to stand what you
git.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I care to eat,” announced Ralph.
“We had a pretty substantial lunch on the motor
boat.”</p>

<p>“The same here,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we might as well see what they’ve
got,” came from Andy, whose curiosity was
aroused. In spite of the peril, the fun-loving
Rover boy enjoyed the novelty of the situation.</p>

<p>“I think I could go any kind of a cup of coffee,
as long as it was hot,” said his twin.</p>

<p>Led by the tall, lanky sailor, whose name they
afterward ascertained was Ira Small, they sat
down at one end of the mess table and were served
with a stew of unknown ingredients, some rye
bread and black coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“This is the snake’s toothbrush, and no mistake!”
declared Fred, in disgust. “I wouldn’t
feed the pigs such stuff as this.”</p>

<p>The boys sampled the food, drank a little of
the coffee, and then left the table, several of the
hands sneering at them and looking anything but
friendly. These hands had bottles of liquor
which were passed around freely. One offered
his bottle to Jack, but the young major shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t drink,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink, eh?” sniffed the sailor. “Well,
you don’t know what you miss.”</p>

<p>Slowly the evening wore away and the <i>Hildegarde</i>
kept on her course. The fog was now
lifting slowly, and with this came an increase in
the wind, so that the craft made much better
speed than before.</p>

<p>Jack had noted that the tall sailor named Ira
Small did not associate much with the other
hands. The fellow was a peculiar sort of individual,
given to talking to himself and to rubbing
his chin as if trying to refresh his memory
over something.</p>

<p>“That fellow is a character,” whispered the
young major to Ralph. “He doesn’t seem to belong
to this bunch at all. I wonder how he got
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe they shanghaied him, just the way they
shanghaied us, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’re going to keep us on
board long, Ralph?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I must confess I don’t like
the looks of things at all.”</p>

<p>“Randy has an idea that they’ll rob us of
everything we’ve got,” said Spouter, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Well, they certainly look like a bunch of
thieves, or worse,” returned Jack.</p>

<p>“I made a mistake by letting that fellow Ferguson
know that the <i>Fancy</i> is brand new,” said
Ralph. “They’ll have their eyes on her, sure!
They know she is worth quite a bunch of money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and those rum-runners from shore could
use such a motor boat very nicely,” remarked
Randy.</p>

<p>“But if they keep the boat, how are we going
to get ashore?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe they’ll put us ashore in a rowboat,”
answered Jack. “It would be just like
them to do it. They may leave us with nothing
but our bare clothing, and they may even take
our things and give us some of their old rags.”</p>

<p>Looking at it from every point of view, it was
a disheartening situation. One instant the boys
felt like arming themselves as best they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and making a break for liberty; but the next,
caution prevailed, and they knew that such a
move would bring on a fight that might prove
fatal to one or more of them.</p>

<p>When it came two bells in the first night watch
Letts told the boys they could turn in and showed
them where they could sleep in some vacant bunks
and on the floor of the forecastle.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to let us go ashore?” questioned
Ralph.</p>

<p>“Not to-night. Perhaps we’ll be able to let
you go in the morning. You couldn’t do anything,
anyhow, in this heavy fog.”</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and so the boys
turned in, although none of them undressed. In
some bunks not far away several sailors were
already snoring lustily, so the boys had to keep
quiet for fear of raising a new row.</p>

<p>It was a night long to be remembered. For
some time neither Jack nor any of the others
could go to sleep. All were cudgeling their
brains to think of some way by which they might
gain their liberty. But nothing came to their
minds that sounded feasible. At last, worn out
by their exertions, one after another dropped off
to sleep, Fred being the last to close his eyes.</p>

<p>It was early morning when Jack got up. The
others were still slumbering, and as there seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
no need to arouse them, he slipped quietly out of
the forecastle to the deck. It was still raining,
but the fog was clearing away rapidly and a
strong wind was blowing from the northeast.
All of the sails of the <i>Hildegarde</i> were set, and
the auxiliary engine was silent.</p>

<p>The oldest Rover boy found only three hands
on deck, one of whom was at the wheel. One
of the hands proved to be Ira Small, and the
tall, lanky sailor grinned slightly at him as he
came up.</p>

<p>“Got a little sleep, I hope?” said Small, blinking
his eyes and rubbing his chin vigorously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I slept fairly well after I once got to
sleep,” answered Jack. “I was worn out—we
had put in such a big day.”</p>

<p>Ira Small looked at him questioningly for several
seconds and then looked up and down the
deck to make sure that they were not being observed.
Then he leaned forward impressively,
his long neck extending like that of a duck.</p>

<p>“They ain’t got no right to keep you on board
this ship, lad. It’s a blamed shame, that’s what
it is! I wish I could help you and your crowd
to git away.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for that,” said Jack, his eyes lighting
up. “I’m glad to know we have one friend
on board this vessel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“I reckon I made a big mistake when I shipped
with Cap’n Gilsen,” went on the tall sailor, rubbing
one ear and then the other vigorously and
then rubbing his chin. “I knew he was in the
rum-runnin’ business, but I thought I could switch
him on to somethin’ worth more money.”</p>

<p>“Where does this schooner hail from?”</p>

<p>“From Jamaica, lad. But don’t you let ’em
know I told you,” went on Ira Small, impressively.
“They don’t like me none too well as it
is, and they’d like me still less if they knowed
that I was tryin’ to help you fellows.”</p>

<p>“From Jamaica!”</p>

<p>“That’s it. And the ship’s made two trips
since I been on board. I wanted to desert the
first time we come up here with licker, but I
didn’t git no chance. You see, when I shipped,
as I said afore, I thought I could int’rest Cap’n
Gilsen in somethin’ that would be worth more to
him than this rum-runnin’ business. But he
won’t listen to me. He thinks I’m crazy.” Ira
Small shook his head vigorously and then rubbed
his chin once more. “Well, maybe I am. But
just the same, some day I’m goin’ to find them
thirteen rocks.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to find what?” questioned Jack,
puzzled.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to find them thirteen rocks somewheres<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
down in the West Indies. I’ve got
photygraphs of ’em, and I know jest what they
look like.”</p>

<p>“Thirteen rocks!” repeated Jack. “What good
would it do you to find those thirteen rocks?”</p>

<p>“Ha! That’s jest it!” The sailor closed one
eye suggestively, glaring at the young major with
the other. “The thirteen rocks is where the
pirates buried their treasure—thousands and
thousands of dollars’ worth!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>PLANNING TO ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ira Small glared at Jack in such an impressive
manner that the young major of the Colby
Hall battalion was not a little disturbed. He
did not wonder over the fact that Captain Gilsen
had thought the sailor crazy.</p>

<p>“It would be very fine to find the pirates’ treasure,”
he returned briefly. “But just now what
I am more interested in is getting away from this
schooner.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you, lad! I don’t blame you!
It’s a poor place for any one to be. An’ it’s
much worse than it is now when the men git to
drinkin’ and fightin’. I’ve been through it a
dozen times, an’ I know! I was a big fool to
ever come on board!”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you leave?”</p>

<p>“Easier said nor done, lad. The cap’n knows
I don’t want to stay with him, an’ he an’ the
mate watch me like a dog his bone. I’d git
away fast enough if I had the chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll talk about this again. Don’t say anything
about it now,” warned Jack hastily, as he
saw the mate of the <i>Hildegarde</i> approaching,
having just come from below to take his trick
at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Where are the other young fellows?” questioned
Letts, shortly, as he gazed suspiciously at
Jack and then at the retreating form of Ira
Small.</p>

<p>“They haven’t come on deck yet, so I suppose
they’re sleeping,” answered Jack. “Are you
ready to let us take our boat and go?” he went on.</p>

<p>“We may let you go as soon as it clears a bit.
But about taking your motor boat, that’s another
story. Bill Ferguson, the captain’s partner, says
he has a claim on it.”</p>

<p>“A claim? I don’t see how that can be!”</p>

<p>“It was you and your uncle who were responsible
for smashing up an automobile with all the
liquor aboard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s his scheme!” cried Jack, his eyes
flashing. “He expects us to settle that bill, does
he? Well, I’ll tell you right now, he has another
guess coming to him! He and that fellow
with him were responsible for that accident, and
not I—nor my uncle. Besides that, the boat
belongs to Mr. Mason. I have no claim on
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“Ferguson says you’re all in together and
you’ll have to settle for that smash-up before you
can have that motor boat.”</p>

<p>“What does he put his claim at? Not that
I’ve any idea of settling it.”</p>

<p>“He says that it’ll cost at least three hundred
dollars to repair the car, and he lost over a thousand
dollars’ worth of liquor.”</p>

<p>“He had no right to be transporting the
liquor.”</p>

<p>“Fairy tales, lad! Fairy tales!” answered
the mate sarcastically. “Everybody’s doing it.
You’ve got to settle with Ferguson before we
let you take that boat.” And thus speaking the
mate walked away to relieve the man at the
wheel.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the boys were in anything
but a happy frame of mind when they went
to get the scanty and badly-cooked breakfast
which was offered to them. Jack had told the
others what the mate had said, and all were justly
indignant.</p>

<p>“I believe they’re nothing but a bunch of
thieves,” was Fred’s comment. “This is only an
excuse for robbing us of the motor boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I think!” put in Gif. “Gee,
I wish we could arm ourselves in some way and
compel these fellows to run the schooner ashore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry I got you into so much trouble,
Ralph,” said Jack to his friend. “I didn’t know
that fellow Ferguson would be on board,” and
he grinned.</p>

<p>“It’s not your fault at all, Jack,” returned
Ralph, quickly. “That’s only an excuse to keep
the motor boat. I believe these fellows haven’t
any conscience and they will take everything
we’ve got before they let us go.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they won’t let us go even then,” put
in Randy. “You know the old saying, ‘Dead
men tell no tales.’ They may take us to sea and
drop us overboard.”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar, Randy! you’re the cat’s slippers
for scaring us to death,” burst out his twin.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think they’ll go as far as that,”
came from Spouter. “They wouldn’t dare. But
they may take everything we’ve got of value,
and then turn us adrift in one of their rowboats.”</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do?” questioned Jack.
“Shall we try to arm ourselves and fight?”</p>

<p>“It may come to that later, Jack,” answered
Ralph. “But just yet I wouldn’t advise it.”</p>

<p>“Neither would I,” said Gif.</p>

<p>“A fight would only give them an excuse for
shooting us down,” remarked Fred.</p>

<p>Slowly the day passed, and with it went the
mist and rain. The wind was now blowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
freely, and the <i>Hildegarde</i> made good progress
on her course. The boys were not given a chance
to look at the compass, but, by the sun, knew they
must be heading southward. Not a speck of land
was anywhere in sight.</p>

<p>“That shows they didn’t go down the coast as
they said they would,” said Jack, about the middle
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose they’re bound for?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’re going straight back to Jamaica,”
suggested Spouter.</p>

<p>“Or to some other island of the West Indies
where they can get another supply of liquor,”
added Randy.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the stern and take a look at the
motor boat,” said Ralph.</p>

<p>“Maybe they won’t let you go to the stern,”
said Andy.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon find out.”</p>

<p>“Ralph certainly has a right to look after his
own boat,” put in Gif. “Gosh! these chaps are
carrying things with a high hand,” he added,
with a serious shake of his head.</p>

<p>“On the high seas a captain’s word is law,”
said Fred. “So this fellow takes it for granted
he can do as he pleases.”</p>

<p>“I wish a revenue cutter would show up,”
came from Spouter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“I guess we all wish that,” answered Jack, with
a faint smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we could only have the whole crowd
placed under arrest!” muttered Randy.</p>

<p>All of the boys walked toward the stern of the
schooner, but speedily found themselves confronted
by Captain Gilsen and Bill Ferguson.
One of the sailors was now at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” demanded the commander
of the <i>Hildegarde</i>, curtly.</p>

<p>“I wanted to take a look at my motor boat to
see if it was all right,” answered Ralph.</p>

<p>“The motor boat is all O. K., and I’m claimin’
it,” came from Bill Ferguson. “I’m goin’ to
keep it for the damage done to my auto and the
liquor I was carryin’.”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with that accident, and
the motor boat belongs to my father,” answered
Ralph.</p>

<p>“See here! You keep a civil tongue in your
head, or there’ll be trouble on this schooner,” bellowed
Ferguson. “All of you fellows are in this
together, and I guess one is about as responsible
as another. Better make ’em go forward, Cap’n,
and behave themselves,” he added to his partner.</p>

<p>“I want the motor boat, and I want it right
now,” answered Ralph. “The storm has cleared
away, and we want to go ashore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>“You talk like that to me, and the next thing
you know you’ll be in the ship’s brig!” roared
Captain Gilsen. “We’re on the high seas now,
and I’m in command here. Every one of you
get forward, and be quick about it! I’ll let you
know when you can go ashore.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll go forward,” answered Ralph,
stiffly. “Just the same, I want you to understand
that you’re laying up a lot of trouble for
yourself.”</p>

<p>Another war of words followed, several of
the hands, and likewise the mate, coming to the
scene to look on. In the end, there was almost
a pitched battle, the captain shaking his fist in
the boys’ faces and threatening them with all
sorts of punishment if they did not behave themselves
and do exactly as he ordered. Ferguson
also took part in the argument, and even grabbed
Jack by the arm.</p>

<p>“You thought you could get away from me;
but you can’t,” he said, with a leer. “You’re
goin’ to pay good and plenty for that auto
wreck.”</p>

<p>“Let go of my arm!” returned Jack, and gave
the fellow a shove that sent him backward against
the ship’s rail. At this Ferguson became furious,
and would have drawn a pistol had not the
mate of the <i>Hildegarde</i> interposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“No use of fighting now,” he said. “We’ve
got a better way of squaring accounts,” and he
looked suggestively at Ferguson.</p>

<p>“All right. Just as you say,” was the surly
response. “But that young cub has got to be
taught a lesson, and I’m the man to teach it to
him.”</p>

<p>This quarrel made the position of the boys
more uncomfortable than ever. They moved
forward while several of the sailors jeered at
them. Evidently the whole crowd was against
the lads, the single exception being Ira Small.
The tall, lanky sailor had some work to do, and
this he did without taking part in the discussion
or what followed.</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose we are?” asked Fred,
after another hour had passed and the breeze
seemed to be stronger than ever.</p>

<p>“I think we’re somewhere off the Jersey coast,”
answered Ralph. “But how far east I can’t tell.
There isn’t a sign of land anywhere.”</p>

<p>Slowly the hours dragged by, the boys not
knowing what to think of the situation.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we can’t get aboard the motor
boat to-night,” said Randy. “Of course, we’d
have to be very careful about it. But if she is
tied on behind, why couldn’t we slip down on the
cable, one after another, and get aboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“That might be all right,” said Jack. “But
we’d have to take some grub along, and we’d
have to be sure that we had gasoline.”</p>

<p>It was not until evening that Jack had another
opportunity to talk to Ira Small.</p>

<p>“See here, Small,” he said, when they met in
the semi-darkness, “if you want to leave the
<i>Hildegarde</i>, why don’t you come aboard the motor
boat with us?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to do it first rate,” answered the
sailor, in a whisper. “But we’d have to be
mighty careful or they’d be sure to spot us.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we could get hold of any provisions
and some water to drink?”</p>

<p>“It might be done, lad. But we’d have to be
mighty careful, I’ll tell you. If they saw any of
us runnin’ away they’d shoot at us as sure as
I’m standin’ here.”</p>

<p>“What about gasoline? Have they any on
board?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they’ve a couple o’ barrels. You see,
sometimes those small boats from shore have to
hang around a long time to keep out o’ the way
of revenue cutters. Then they use up their gasoline,
and they’re glad ’nough to git a new supply
from the schooner.”</p>

<p>“Where is the gasoline kept?”</p>

<p>“In the oil room up in the bow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“Locked up?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But the lock ain’t o’ much account,
and could easy be broke.”</p>

<p>“What about grub?”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I don’t think we could git
a-hold of much. But we might git some—’nough
to last, say, a day or two.”</p>

<p>“And water?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we could git water easy ’nough.”</p>

<p>“Could we make it to-night?” asked Jack,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Better not try it to-night, lad. After what
happened on deck this afternoon, you’ll be
watched close. Better take it easy and pretend
you’re waitin’ for what may turn up. It may
be they’ll let you go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they will,” answered Jack.
“But if they do, do you want to go with us?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go if I kin make it,” answered Ira Small.
“P’r’aps I kin drop overboard quiet like and git
aboard the motor boat without their seein’ me.”</p>

<p>“Is anybody aboard the motor boat now?”
questioned Jack, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. She comes along all right alone, so
the sailor who was on board come back to the
ship.”</p>

<p>“Well, Small, you stick to us, and we’ll stick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
to you. You help us escape, and you shall be
well rewarded.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want no reward. I want to git square
with Cap’n Gilsen an’ his bunch,” answered Ira
Small. “I’d like to git away in the motor boat
an’ blow the <i>Hildegarde</i> to kingdom come. That
bunch of critters on board this ship ain’t fit to
live.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see you again about this,” said
Jack, as he noted the approach of Letts.</p>

<p>“All right, lad. I’ll be ready at the first
chance. I want to git away just as quick as you
do. I want to git back to the West Indies an’
spot the thirteen rocks. I’m after pirates’ gold!”
concluded the lanky sailor, as he stalked away
hastily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>ANOTHER PLOT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before they retired for the night, the boys
talked the situation over once more.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we can’t make a break for
it,” grumbled Randy. “We can wait until about
two or three o’clock in the morning. Nearly
everybody will be sound asleep by that time, and
we could steal to the stern and get to the motor
boat by the cable without half trying.”</p>

<p>“Yes! But how about grub?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p>“And how about gasoline?” put in Ralph.
“We couldn’t run very long on the supply that
was left when we were captured. We were running
mighty low, and I was afraid we would go
short before we got out of the fog.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to remember one thing,” observed
Spouter. “If they found us trying to steal away
in the darkness, they’d have no mercy on us.
They’d probably handcuff us and throw us in the
ship’s brig and feed us the poorest food they
have on board.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and they’d probably steal everything
we’ve got in the bargain,” came from Gif.</p>

<p>In the end they resolved to take Ira Small’s
advice and wait at least another day.</p>

<p>All of the other lads had listened with interest
to what Jack had told them about the lanky sailor’s
yarn of thirteen rocks and the pirates’ hidden
gold.</p>

<p>“It might not be such a fairy tale as you
think,” said Fred. “If you’ll remember, the pirates
of years gone by hid lots of gold and other
treasure on out-of-the-way islands of the West
Indies.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that was a good many years ago,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I was reading in a newspaper
only a short while ago about a hunt being made
along the South American coast for a treasure
said to have been secreted there by one of the
notorious buccaneers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve all read such yarns,” put in Gif.
“There may be some pirates’ gold somewhere.
But I’ll wager it’s so well hidden it will never
be brought to light. Why, folks have been digging
for Captain Kidd’s gold ever since I can
remember.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he means by thirteen rocks?”
mused Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“There must be thirteen rocks around the place—maybe
pointed ones,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“In that case, if I ever get down to the West
Indies I’m going to keep my eyes open for the
lucky thirteen,” grinned Randy.</p>

<p>The sea air made the boys drowsy, and although
several of them thought to keep awake,
almost before they knew it each of them was
sound asleep. Nor did any of them rouse up
until the golden sun was peeping up over the
eastern rim of the ocean.</p>

<p>“Gosh, what a disagreeable smell around
here!” muttered Gif, as he arose and stretched
himself. “It makes my head ache.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny. I’ve got a headache myself,”
replied Jack, who sat on the edge of one of the
rough bunks, rubbing his eyes. “I feel just as
if I’d been in a swing, or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’re getting seasick,” came dismally
from Fred. He, too, had just arisen, and his
face was unusually pale while he seemed to
breathe with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Say, Fred, you certainly look odd!” cried
Jack. “Do you really think you’re getting seasick?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the slow response from
the youngest Rover. “I never felt so queer in
my life,” he went on, as he took a few staggering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
steps around the forecastle. “Guess I need
a little fresh air. It’s dreadfully close in
here.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be so very late,” said Ralph. He felt
for his watch, and then uttered an exclamation.
“My watch is gone!” He thrust his hands into
his pockets. “My money is gone, too, and so
are my keys! Everything is gone!”</p>

<p>Jack and the others gazed at Ralph in astonishment.
Then simultaneously they felt in their
own pockets.</p>

<p>“My watch is gone too!”</p>

<p>“So is mine!”</p>

<p>“My diamond scarf pin is gone!”</p>

<p>“So is my ruby ring!”</p>

<p>“I’m cleaned out of everything!”</p>

<p>“Gee, fellows! they’ve robbed us!” groaned
Randy. “They took everything we carried while
we were asleep.”</p>

<p>“How could they do that without some of us
waking up?” questioned Spouter. “We don’t all
sleep like logs at once, do we?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” exclaimed Jack. “Don’t you remember
that funny smell we noticed when we
first awoke? I’ll bet five dollars to a cent they
drugged us!”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” broke in Ralph, eagerly. “Sure
they did! That’s the smell of chloroform. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
know, for we used it once when dad chloroformed
our old sick cat.”</p>

<p>The others felt that their chum was right, and
everybody boiled with indignation over this new
indignity that had been heaped upon them.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a shotgun—I’d show them a
thing or two!” cried Jack, his eyes blazing wrathfully.
“Captain Gilsen and his gang are nothing
but a bunch of pirates!”</p>

<p>“Maybe the captain didn’t do it. This may
be the work of Ferguson or Letts, or some of the
others,” remarked Spouter.</p>

<p>But the others could not agree with this. They
were of the opinion that the theft had been committed
by those in authority on board the craft.
Nevertheless, they took it upon themselves to
question several of the sailors who were just
arising.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got any of your stuff, Buddy,” growled
one of the men. “And don’t you say I have,
either, or I’ll knock your block off,” and he glared
wickedly at the boys.</p>

<p>“If you’ve been robbed, go to the cap’n with
your yarn,” said another.</p>

<p>“I will go to the captain!” returned Jack.
“I’m not going to stand for any such treatment
any longer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“And I’m with you!” broke in Randy. “Come
on, let’s arm ourselves!”</p>

<p>The boys were thoroughly aroused, and each
looked around the forecastle for something which
might be used as a weapon.</p>

<p>“Take my advice and go slow, you kids,”
growled one of the sailors. “The cap’n and Ferguson
and Letts go well heeled, and they’d jest
as lief fill you full of holes as not. You’ve seen
a little roughness so far, but you haven’t seen
nothin’ of what might happen if you got those
men worked up. The cap’n won’t stop at nothin’
when he’s roused up.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the boys left the forecastle, each
armed with a stick or a spike, or whatever came
to hand.</p>

<p>Just as they came on deck they ran into Ira
Small. The lanky sailor looked at the weapons
they carried, and then shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it. Throw them clubs away,”
he whispered hoarsely. “If you start a fight
you’ll git the worst of it and spile everything.
Take a meek-like way. Pretend you ain’t got no
backbone—that you’re scared stiff—and then
maybe we’ll git a chance to outwit ’em. I know
how I can git some grub and the gasoline you
want,” he went on impressively. Then, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
saw the mate approaching, he hurried back to
where he had been busy coiling up some ropes.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” demanded the
mate, coming to a halt and eyeing the clubs and
other things the boys carried.</p>

<p>“We were robbed last night, and we want to
know who did it,” answered Jack, coldly.</p>

<p>“Robbed! What do you mean?” and the mate
tried to put on an air of innocence.</p>

<p>“While we were asleep our watches, money
and everything else was taken away from us,”
said Randy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” replied
the mate. “But you listen to me,” he went on
sternly. “Drop those things, or it’ll be the worse
for you.”</p>

<p>“I want to talk to Captain Gilsen and to that
fellow Ferguson,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“They’re both asleep. You can’t see ’em.”</p>

<p>Some bitter words followed, and it was all the
boys could do to keep themselves from pouncing
upon the mate and giving him the thrashing they
felt he deserved. In the midst of the talking,
Captain Gilsen and Ferguson appeared, each
carrying a pistol.</p>

<p>“You boys get forward and stay there, and
no more nonsense!” roared the captain, when
they had again mentioned the robbery. “If I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
hear another word out of you, I’ll put you in the
brig.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, this is dreadful!” exclaimed Andy,
and suddenly burst out crying, much to the
amazement of the others. But when he had his
back turned on the captain and the other enemies,
he winked at his twin and at Fred.</p>

<p>“Cry!” he whispered. “Cry for all you’re
worth! Make ’em think we’re licked bad.
Then they won’t watch us.”</p>

<p>Catching the cue, Fred began to blubber, and
Randy followed suit. At first the others were
amazed, but then they saw through the trick, and
all suddenly looked glum.</p>

<p>“It ain’t fair,” whined Jack, in tearful tones.
“It ain’t fair at all, Captain Gilsen. I think you
ought to let us go.”</p>

<p>“I want to go home!” groaned Gif. “I want
to go home!”</p>

<p>“We didn’t do anything to you,” said Spouter,
mournfully.</p>

<p>“Some day you’ll catch it! You see if you
don’t!” bewailed Ralph, and the seven boys retreated
slowly to the forward deck of the <i>Hildegarde</i>,
acting as if thoroughly cowed.</p>

<p>“I reckon they’ve learned their little lesson,”
was Captain Gilsen’s comment. “I thought I
could break ’em sooner or later. I’ll bet in another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
day they’ll be willing to eat out of my
hand.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got another scheme,” said Ferguson, a
few minutes later, when the boys were out of
hearing. “Perhaps we can make a barrel of
money out of this.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if those boys came from
pretty wealthy families. They wear good clothes
and they all had fine jewelry and plenty of
spendin’ money. Don’t you think their folks
would pay a good price to have the boys back
home safe and sound?”</p>

<p>“You mean hold them for a ransom, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Why not? That has been done before, and
folks have paid handsome, too.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I hadn’t thought of that, but it
might be worth considering,” answered the captain
of the <i>Hildegarde</i>, pulling meditatively at
his moustache.</p>

<p>“It would be a dead easy thing to do,” continued
Ferguson. “We could sail the schooner
over to one o’ those little islands where nobody
lives and git ’em to sign letters askin’ their folks
to pay up to have ’em released. Why, say,
Cap’n, we might make thousands of dollars out
of it—a good deal more’n we ever made out o’
the liquor business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but think of the risk we’d be running.
It’s a big crime to kidnap people like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, look at the risk we run gettin’ liquor
into the States. Some day those revenue cutters
will open fire on us and maybe blow us to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Let’s find out a little more about the boys,”
said Captain Gilsen, after a moment’s thought.
“If their folks are real well off, it might pay to
do as you say. I think the crew will stand for
it all right enough, and I know Letts would be
all right—he’s been mixed up in half-a-dozen
shady transactions.”</p>

<p>“Why, say! just look at what we might make
out of it,” cried Ferguson, his eyes glistening
greedily. “If we got only ten thousand dollars
for the safe delivery of each boy, that would
amount to seventy thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“Humph! If their folks are really wealthy,
perhaps we can get two or three times that
amount out of ’em, Bill,” returned the captain,
tugging on his moustache more fiercely than ever.
“If we go into this at all, we might as well do
it right. Of course, we’d run a big risk, but a
hundred thousand dollars—or maybe two hundred
thousand—isn’t to be sneezed at.”</p>

<small>IRA SMALL’S REVELATIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Andy, I never knew you could cry so cheerfully,”
remarked Jack, when the boys were once
more by themselves and were sure that no outsiders
were observing them.</p>

<p>“He’d make a hit on the vaudeville stage,”
came from Spouter. “Gosh! when he first
started I thought he was really crying.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” added Gif. “And I didn’t know
what to make of it, for Andy isn’t built that
way.”</p>

<p>“Now we’ve started to appear as if we are half
scared to death, I suppose we’ve got to keep it
up,” remarked Randy.</p>

<p>“Sure we’ve got to keep it up,” answered Jack,
promptly. “It’s a good stunt. We have to hand
it to that sailor, Small. He certainly had the
right idea.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he isn’t as crazy as some people think,”
said Fred. “Lots of people are peculiar, but that
doesn’t make them insane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t find out anything about the
things that were stolen,” remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>“If we leave the schooner, we’ll probably have
to leave those things behind,” said Fred. “It’s
a shame! I’d like to sneak into the cabin some
time and take a look around.”</p>

<p>“So would I!” came simultaneously from the
twins.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you,” answered Jack. “Just
the same, please remember that if we want to get
away from this schooner soon, we’ve got to be
mighty careful about what we do. If they discover
us in any underhand work, they’ll come
down on us like a thousand of brick.”</p>

<p>While the boys talked the matter over near
the bow of the schooner, Captain Gilsen, Ferguson
and Letts held a conference in the cabin
of the <i>Hildegarde</i>.</p>

<p>“That sounds pretty good to me,” said the
mate, after Ferguson had unfolded the plan already
broached to the captain. “Of course, we
might have a lot of trouble communicating with
those boys’ folks, and more trouble getting them
to pay up, but I think it could be done.”</p>

<p>“Of course it could be done!” replied Captain
Gilsen, tugging on his moustache as usual.
“I’ve been thinking it over hard, and I’m sure
I know just where we can take ’em; a small island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
off the coast of Porto Rico. From there we can
easily get into communication with the mainland
and send out telegrams to their folks.”</p>

<p>“Those boys may cut up pretty wild when they
understand what is going on,” remarked the
mate.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they will,” answered Ferguson.
“We’ve got ’em pretty well cowed.”</p>

<p>“How you going to keep them from pestering
us about going ashore with the motor boat?”</p>

<p>“We’ll concoct a story that the revenue cutters
are after us, and that we’ve got to keep pretty
well out to sea,” was the reply. “We can tell
’em that it’s too rough ’way out there for the
motor boat and that they’ll be safer aboard the
schooner.”</p>

<p>Thereafter the three men went into an earnest
discussion of the subject and finally decided that
they would go into the scheme on equal shares
and that each would assume an equal risk.</p>

<p>“We can easily buy up the whole crew,” said
Letts. “I think a hundred dollars to each man
will fix it up.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one fellow I don’t trust, and
that’s Small,” said Captain Gilsen. “He’s a first-class
hand, but there’s something about him I
don’t like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about Small. We can easily
manage him,” sneered the mate. “Why, that
fellow is half crazy. He’s talking about pirates’
gold and that sort of rot all the time. Just
promise him that you’ll go after that treasure
after this affair is taken care of, and he’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p>Then the three men discussed the subject of
whether or not it would be advisable to treat the
boys better than had been done.</p>

<p>“They’re not common sailors, or anything like
that,” remarked Letts. “I suppose it galls ’em
to be herded in the fo’castle. Maybe they’d take
it better if we gave ’em accommodations in the
cabin, although how we’re going to crowd ’em
in, I don’t see.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” howled Ferguson. “I don’t
believe in bein’ nice to ’em! Treat ’em rough—that’s
my way! Treat ’em rough!”</p>

<p>“I think Bill is right,” said the captain. “If
we continue to treat ’em rough, they’ll be easier
to handle when it comes to writing letters home
in order to obtain their release. We’ll scare them
out of their wits.”</p>

<p>“And on the other hand, if they agree to do
everything we tell ’em, we can promise that they’ll
get back everything we took away from ’em,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
added Ferguson. “Of course, we don’t have to
give the things back, but we can promise it,” and
he leered wickedly at his companions.</p>

<p>However, there was one thing the plotters did
do, somewhat to the boys’ surprise. When the
call came to dinner they found that Captain Gilsen
had given orders that they have one of the
tables in the forecastle to themselves. And on
this the meal served was a decided improvement
over those previously supplied.</p>

<p>“This is something like,” said Randy, as he
tasted the stew and then sipped some of the coffee.
“It shows the cook knows his business
when he wants to.”</p>

<p>“Those men have got something up their sleeve
or they wouldn’t be giving us this food,” returned
Jack, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’re getting a little bit scared over
what may be coming to them,” said Gif.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it’s that, Gif,” returned
the young major.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the afternoon that
Letts came up to where Jack and Ralph were
standing and smiled rather dubiously at them.</p>

<p>“We’re in a hole, and you fellows have got to
stand for it,” said the mate. “We thought we
could run closer to land and let you take your
motor boat and go ashore. But we saw some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
signals a while back, and we’ve got to change
our plan entirely.”</p>

<p>“Signals?” queried Ralph. “What sort of
signals? I didn’t see anything.”</p>

<p>“No; because you weren’t looking in the right
direction and because you didn’t have a spy-glass,”
returned Letts. “The captain got signals
that two revenue cutters are searching for us.
So instead of going inshore we’re going out.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—out on the ocean?” demanded
Jack, quickly.</p>

<p>“That’s it, lad. And we intend to keep out
until we’re sure the coast is clear. Besides that,
we’ll be better off outside, I think, because another
storm is coming.”</p>

<p>The boys did not know whether to believe the
mate of the <i>Hildegarde</i> or not. However, there
was nothing they could do to improve matters,
so they did not argue with him. They had already
noted that the sun was going under some
heavy clouds and that the breeze was freshening.</p>

<p>“They’ve certainly got something up their
sleeve regarding us,” said Jack, when he and
Ralph were telling the others what the mate had
said.</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t look as if we can do anything
about getting away to-night,” said Fred. “I just
had a chance to talk to Ira Small, and he said it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
wouldn’t be any use—that we’re too far out on
the Atlantic and that the storm is coming up
fast.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’ll do with the motor boat
if the storm gets very heavy!” cried Ralph.
“Maybe they’ll cut it adrift!”</p>

<p>“They won’t want to throw away such a valuable
craft unless it becomes absolutely necessary,”
returned Jack. “I think those fellows are out
for every dollar they can get—their robbing us
proves it!”</p>

<p>By the time the boys went to supper the wind
was blowing strongly and the <i>Hildegarde</i> was
pitching and tossing on the broad bosom of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>“It’s goin’ to be a real storm, to my way o’
thinkin’,” said Ira Small, when he had a chance
to speak to the lads. “You kin be thankful
you’re not out in it in your motor boat. That
craft couldn’t make much headway in sech a sea
as the wind is kickin’ up.”</p>

<p>“Have they done anything about the motor
boat?” questioned Ralph.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ve covered her with a tarpaulin and
hitched her on with a cable that’s twice as long
and three times as strong as the first one was.
I reckon they’re goin’ to save her if they possibly
kin, no matter how hard it blows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Where do you think we are, Small?”</p>

<p>“We’re jest about east o’ Cape Hatteras. An’
lemme tell you, that’s some place to be in when
a storm comes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve heard all about Cape Hatteras and
the awful storms they have in that vicinity,”
said Fred. “Gee, maybe this old tub will go to
the bottom!”</p>

<p>That night on the <i>Hildegarde</i> proved to be one
the boys never forgot. The wind seemed to blow
stronger and stronger until the vessel was rolling
and pitching in a manner that made it dangerous
to cross the deck. Nearly every stitch
of canvas had been taken in, only enough being
left set to give the schooner steerage way. There
were several showers, but nothing in the way of
a heavy downpour, and what little there was of
thunder and lightning kept in the distance.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mighty thankful we’re not out in
the motor boat,” remarked Randy.</p>

<p>“So am I,” answered Fred. “I don’t believe
we could do a thing in such a wind as this.”</p>

<p>“Do you notice that it is not as cold as it was?”
remarked Jack. “This breeze is quite warm.”</p>

<p>“That’s because it is coming from the south,”
answered Spouter. “You must remember that
the farther south we go, the warmer it’s going
to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“If we’re off Cape Hatteras we’re a good way
from home,” put in Ralph. “Hang the luck,
anyhow! Why did we have to run into these
miserable bootleggers?”</p>

<p>By midnight the storm was at its height.
Sleep for the boys was out of the question, and
they huddled together near the door of the forecastle,
talking in low tones and wishing for daylight
to come.</p>

<p>“It sure is a humdinger of a night!” exclaimed
Ira Small, when he came in from his watch on
deck. “The sea is gettin’ worse an’ worse ev’ry
minute.”</p>

<p>“How long do you think this storm will last,
Small?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Can’t say, lad. It may blow itself out by
mornin’, and it may last two or three days. We
ain’t in the worst of it—the worst seems to be
farther down the coast.”</p>

<p>To the dismay of the boys, the storm at daybreak
was as bad as ever. The sea was now
running strong and the <i>Hildegarde</i> could hardly
keep on her course despite the fact that some sail
was set and the auxiliary engine was being used.</p>

<p>The storm seemed to have a bad effect on the
sailors. As much as possible they remained in
the forecastle, and three or four of them insisted
upon drinking heavily. Soon there was a violent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
quarrel, and one man was hit on the head
with a bottle and knocked unconscious. Then
the captain and the mate were called in, and two
of the sailors were placed in irons until they
could sober up.</p>

<p>“I must say I’m disgusted with the bunch sailing
with me,” said Captain Gilsen to Ferguson,
after the quarrel had quieted down. “If we can
make that bunch of money we spoke about out
of those kids, I’ll be willing to discharge every
one of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’d better hold ’em together the best
we can until we’ve put our plan through,” answered
Ferguson.</p>

<p>All day long and the following night the wind
kept up, and the <i>Hildegarde</i> had all it could do
to keep on its course. But to the delight of the
boys, they learned that the motor boat was still
in tow and right side up.</p>

<p>“The tarpaulin kep’ most o’ the water out,”
explained Ira Small. “I think she’ll be as good
as ever when the storm clears away.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get what sleep we can,” said Jack, to
his chums. “All of the others on board the
schooner will be worn out because of the storm.
Then, when it calms down, they’ll want to sleep,
and that maybe will give us a chance to see what
we can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>It was not until the following afternoon, when
the storm had subsided and matters were running
fairly smooth, that Ira Small sidled up to Jack,
Ralph and Gif, who chanced to be standing near
the forward rail.</p>

<p>“I’ve got hold o’ that gasoline, and I know
how I kin git some grub and water,” whispered
the lanky sailor hoarsely. “How about it? Do
you want to make a try for it to-night?”</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be safe, Small?” questioned
Ralph.</p>

<p>“You know more about that there motor boat
nor I do, but if I was you boys, I’d not stay on
this here schooner a minute longer’n I had to. I
jest heard somethin’ that you young fellows
might like to hear.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Small?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“If I tell you, will you promise not to give
me away? If they found out I told you, they
might kill me.”</p>

<p>“We won’t say a word,” said Gif, quickly.
“What have you learned?”</p>

<p>“I’ve learned that they ain’t goin’ to let you
go nohow,” answered the lanky sailor. “They’re
goin’ to take you to some island where they’ll
hold you prisoners till your folks pay a whole
barrel o’ money to ransom you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Hold us prisoners?” burst out several of the
boys in chorus.</p>

<p>“That’s what, lads. I had a little work to do
at the stern, and I overheard a talk between Ferguson
and the mate. They got it all fixed with
the cap’n to hold you till your folks pay a whole
lot of money to have you set free.”</p>

<p>“The rascals!” cried Jack, indignantly. “I
knew they had something up their sleeve! I
said so several times!”</p>

<p>“I guess the quicker we make a break for liberty
the better,” put in Gif.</p>

<p>“I’ll not stay on this schooner another night
if I can possibly help it!” was the way Ralph
expressed himself.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you can get the gasoline and
the grub and water?” questioned Fred, hopefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, lad. But, of course, some o’ you have
got to help me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all help!” came eagerly from Randy.
“Just tell us how we can work it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve found out where they keep the key to
the oil room, and I’ve found two empty ten-gallon
cans which can be filled with gasoline.
There is plenty of water, and we can put it into
anything that comes handy.”</p>

<p>“What about grub?” questioned Ralph.</p>

<p>“That’s goin’ to be the hardest part of it; but
there is a good store of everything in the cook’s
galley, and I think we kin git in there and help
ourselves after he turns in. Of course we’ll have
to be mighty careful. If the cap’n caught me
tryin’ to git away, he might shoot me down as
a deserter,” went on the lanky sailor, solemnly.</p>

<p>After that the boys, although trying outwardly
to appear calm, were keyed up to the utmost excitement.
They looked around the forecastle for
some things which might hold drinking water
and found a dozen or more bottles and likewise
the corks that had been in them. Then they
found a jug containing some vile-smelling liquor.</p>

<p>“We can empty that jug when the time comes
and fill that with water also,” said Ralph. “We
can tie it fast to the cable and let it slide down
to the motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s an idea!” said Andy. “Maybe
we can slide some other things down, too. Then
we can cut the cable and haul the stuff on board.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had some chloroform to use on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the whole bunch,” said Fred. “Then maybe
they wouldn’t wake up until well in the morning,
and by that time we might be out of
sight.”</p>

<p>That evening all of the boys ate frugally, stowing
away as much of the meal as they could in
their pockets. Andy also watched his chance,
and took half a loaf of bread from one of the
other tables which the cook had served.</p>

<p>After another conference with Ira Small, it
was decided that Jack and Ralph should aid the
sailor in getting the gasoline. The others were
to watch their chance and enter the cook’s galley
and confiscate anything they could lay hands
on in the way of food.</p>

<p>“And don’t forgit the water,” warned Ira
Small. “On the ocean that’s more important
than something to eat.”</p>

<p>“We know all about that,” answered Fred.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly midnight that the boys
managed to crawl forth from the forecastle one
by one. Several of the sailors were asleep close
by, and the lads felt that all might be lost if
any of these were awakened.</p>

<p>“I’m going to arm myself,” whispered Ralph.
“And if anybody starts anything, I’m going to
try to knock him in the head.”</p>

<p>The others thought this a good suggestion, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
in the end every lad picked up whatever was
handy in the way of a weapon. Then, watching
their chance, one crowd made its way to the
cook’s galley while the other slunk like shadows
to the oil room at the bow.</p>

<p>It proved an easy matter to open the door of
the oil room with the key Ira Small had found.
But it was not near so easy to run the gasoline
from one of the barrels into the two ten-gallon
cans. They did not dare make a light for fear
of an explosion, and it was difficult to work in
the darkness.</p>

<p>But at last they had the cans filled and then
Ira Small led the way to the deck once more.</p>

<p>“Now each of you follow me and carry one
of the cans,” he said. “I’ll go ahead an’ see
if the coast is clear. Don’t make no noise.”</p>

<p>As silently as a ghost the lanky sailor moved
toward the stern of the schooner, on the lookout
for any one who might be on deck. Not far behind
him came the two boys, each struggling with
his ten-gallon can of gasoline, a weight by no
means light.</p>

<p>“Now go slow,” whispered Small, as he
stepped back and brought the lads to a halt. “I
don’t believe that fellow at the wheel is more’n
half awake, but we don’t want to disturb him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>As silently as possible, Ralph and Jack followed
Small up the few steps leading to the stern
deck. There in the semi-darkness they saw one
of the sailors leaning heavily on the wheel. He
had been drinking freely that evening, and for
that reason was not near as alert as he might
otherwise have been.</p>

<p>As they passed the cabin they saw the swinging
lamp was turned low, but no one was in
sight, and they reasoned that the captain and
the mate, as well as Ferguson, had retired.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the other boys had made their
way to the cook’s galley. It was so dark inside
that they could not see a thing, and so were
compelled to light one of some matches which
Randy had obtained from Small. Then they
found a candle and lit this, shading it with their
hands so that it might not let out any more
light than was needed.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pan of baked beans,” whispered
Fred. “What about taking those?”</p>

<p>“Fine—if we can carry them,” answered
Spouter.</p>

<p>“Here are some old flour bags. Why can’t
we put some of the stuff in those?” suggested
Fred, bringing the bags forward.</p>

<p>“A good idea, Fred!” said Andy. “Let’s put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
all the stuff in bags; then we can tie it over our
shoulders and thus keep it out of the water as
much as possible when we slide down that cable
to the <i>Fancy</i>.”</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the boys had collected
a miscellaneous lot of food, including the beans,
several loaves of bread, some biscuits, some
canned vegetables, bacon, butter, cheese, coffee,
condensed milk, sugar and some dried fruit.
Everything was placed in the empty bags and in
a bit of sail cloth they found tacked up over some
shelves.</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’ve got about all we can
carry,” whispered Gif. “We don’t want to overload
ourselves nor stop ourselves from making a
quick get-away.”</p>

<p>The boys were on the point of leaving the
galley with their spoils when suddenly they heard
a noise outside and a moment later a burly form
darkened the doorway.</p>

<p>“Who’s knockin’ round in my galley?” demanded
the voice of the colored cook. “You-all
ain’t got no right to take no food, and you know
it! You had your supper. Now you got to wait
for breakfas’. Come out o’ there!”</p>

<p>The boys were so taken by surprise that for
the instant they did not know what to do. Then
Gif whispered to Spouter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s try to capture him. If he raises an
alarm, we’ll never get away.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s jump him, boys!” called out
Spouter to the others, and then leaped upon the
cook, and Gif followed.</p>

<p>The colored cook was as much surprised as
the boys had been, and before he could recover
from his astonishment he found himself dragged
into the galley and five boys doing their best to
bear him to the floor.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi!” he sputtered. “What you-all up
to? Stop that! Let go of me!”</p>

<p>“Shut up! Don’t dare make a sound!” whispered
Gif, in his ear. “Shut up!”</p>

<p>“Who is you?” questioned the cook. “Is you
one o’ those boys we done took aboard the other
day?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t keep quiet, we’ll heave you overboard,”
added Fred, although he had no intention
of doing anything of the sort.</p>

<p>“Chile, chile! don’t heave me overboard!”
groaned the cook. “I can’t swim! Let go of
me! I ain’t done nothin’!”</p>

<p>During their days on the schooner the boys
had noticed a small hatch only a few feet from
the door to the galley. This hatch had been open
to ventilate the hold, and Gif had looked down
to find the spot beneath empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“You keep quiet,” he ordered, and then he said
to his chums: “I know what to do with him.
As soon as I tell you to come out, bring him
along. And somebody had better put his hand
over the fellow’s mouth for fear he may start to
yell.”</p>

<p>Slipping outside, Gif made his way to the
small hatch and raised it. Then he called softly
to the others, and they came outside, dragging
the cook with them. Randy had his hand over
the fellow’s mouth, and it must be confessed
that the colored cook was thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>“Drop him down the hatchway, quick!” ordered
Gif.</p>

<p>Without ceremony, this command was carried
out, and the poor colored cook found himself
shooting through utter darkness, to land in a
heap in the hold of the schooner. Then the boys
replaced the hatch and ran back into the galley
to get the food they had packed up, and also the
bottles and the jug of water. They were just
starting for the stern when they found themselves
confronted by Ira Small.</p>

<p>“Got the stuff?” whispered the lanky sailor,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Andy.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a little noise up here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“You did,” answered Gif. “We were spotted
by the cook.”</p>

<p>“And we dropped him down the hatchway
over there,” added Spouter.</p>

<p>“Good for you, lads! Good for you! Now
come on—there ain’t no time to lose. That fellow
hangin’ over the wheel may rouse up at any
moment. Besides that, it’s almost time for the
next man to take his trick.”</p>

<p>Once more Ira Small led the way to the stern
of the <i>Hildegarde</i>. There the other boys found
that Jack and Ralph had provided themselves
with a number of short pieces of rope.</p>

<p>“We’re going to loop each of the oil cans fast
to the cable leading down to the motor boat,”
explained Ralph. “You might as well loop all
your bundles also. Of course, a good deal of
it will get wet, but that can’t be helped. We
can’t get it to the boat any other way while we’re
riding through these swells. We’ll be lucky to
get on the boat ourselves.”</p>

<p>While the boys were looping the last of their
bundles fast to the cable where, one after another,
the bundles began to slide down from the
stern of the schooner toward the motor boat,
Ira Small drew back.</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in a couple o’ minutes,” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
said. “You fellows kin follow the stuff down
the cable if you want to. But don’t cut it—I’ll
do that myself as soon as you’re safe on board
and have salvaged the stuff.”</p>

<p>The sailor disappeared in the semi-darkness,
and one after another the boys crawled over the
stern of the <i>Hildegarde</i> and caught hold of the
cable leading down over the ocean to where the
motor boat rested. Fortunately, both wind and
waves had calmed down considerably, so that
the schooner was making but little headway.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter for the boys to reach
the motor boat, and they would have had great
difficulty in getting aboard had it not been that
Captain Gilsen had left an arrangement on the
craft so that a sailor from the <i>Hildegarde</i> might
get on board whenever it was deemed necessary.
This was a sort of rope ladder left across the
bow with a line running from the cabin top to
the cable just above the water line. Floundering
around in the waves and the darkness, one
after another of the boys slid along the cable and
finally managed to reach the motor boat. The
last to come aboard was Jack, and it must be
confessed that he was almost spent with his
exertions.</p>

<p>“Are we all here?” questioned Gif, hanging
fast to one side of the cabin, for they could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
as yet get into the motor boat on account of the
tarpaulin lashed over the cockpit.</p>

<p>Each lad quickly answered that he was there,
for which the whole bunch were thankful.</p>

<p>“Now if only that sailor would come along,
we could cut the cable and let the schooner go on
her way,” said Ralph, as they began to loosen
the tarpaulin.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” exclaimed Fred, excitedly.
“Look at that light on the schooner!”</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire!” was the sudden cry from the
<i>Hildegarde</i>. “Everybody on deck! The ship is
on fire!” And as the boys gazed in consternation,
they saw the flames on the deck of the
schooner mounting higher and higher.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>ON THE MOTOR BOAT AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The ship is on fire!”</p>

<p>“I wonder how that happened?”</p>

<p>“I bet that’s the work of Small!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“More than likely—unless we set fire to something
in the galley,” returned Fred.</p>

<p>“Maybe that loose gasoline caught,” said
Ralph. “Quite a lot of it spilled out on the
oil-room floor in the darkness.”</p>

<p>While the boys gazed at the flames on the
<i>Hildegarde</i> they saw Ira Small rush to the stern.
The next instant the lanky sailor was sliding
down the cable.</p>

<p>“Quick! We ain’t got no time to spare!”
gasped Ira Small, as he hauled himself up to the
motor boat. “Pull in on the cable and then cut
it. But don’t let the stuff on the line git away.”</p>

<p>All of the boys understood what was to be
done, and Jack had already obtained a hatchet
which was in one of the lockers of the motor
boat. While Small, Gif and Spouter hauled in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
on the cable, Ralph and the others continued to
unloosen the tarpaulin. Then the young commander
of the <i>Fancy</i> leaped into the cockpit and
examined the motor.</p>

<p>“Some water here, but still dry enough to run,
I think,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Wait! We don’t want to start up until we’ve
cut loose!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“That’s it, Ralph. If you start up now we
might bump into the schooner. She isn’t making
much headway,” added Randy.</p>

<p>By this time those at the bow had hauled in
five or six yards of the cable. Then the heavy
line was held down on the bow and Jack gave
it several vigorous blows with the hatchet. The
last accomplished its purpose, and the line
snapped, the forward end whizzing back to the
<i>Hildegarde</i>.</p>

<p>“Now we can take the stuff aboard,” said Gif,
and this was quickly accomplished.</p>

<p>Many of the stores were soaked, a fact which
did not please any of them. But they were glad
that they had the things. Otherwise it would
have been folly to attempt to escape in the motor
boat. For all they knew, it might take them
several days to reach land.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the flames on the deck of
the <i>Hildegarde</i> had mounted higher and higher,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
catching on a few of the tarred ratlines of the
mainmast.</p>

<p>“Now hurry up an’ git that engine started!”
cried Ira Small. “We want to git away while
the goin’s good.”</p>

<p>A lantern was lit and in a few minutes Ralph
and one or two of the others had the motor in
working order. Then the battery was turned
on, and in a second more the motor responded
and a steady putt-putt greeted the boys’ ears,
much to their delight.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the wheel!” cried Jack. “You see
that the motor does its duty, Ralph.”</p>

<p>“All right. I think we’ll need some of that
gasoline we brought along before a great while.
You know, I said our supply was running low
when we were captured.”</p>

<p>The <i>Fancy</i> was headed away from the
schooner, and then, as near as he was able, Jack
steered for where he supposed the far-distant
coast might be located. In the meanwhile, the
other lads and Ira Small rested.</p>

<p>“Gee, but that was some get-away!” panted
Andy.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world!” came from Fred. “When
I came down the cable I thought I would never
reach the motor boat. Some strong pull to the
ocean!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“What can you tell us about that fire, Small?”
demanded Gif.</p>

<p>At this question the lanky sailor chuckled
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Scart you, didn’t it? Well, I reckon it’s
scarin’ those left aboard the schooner; and that’s
jest what I want. They’ll be so int’rested
fightin’ that fire, they won’t think nothin’ about
chasin’ us.”</p>

<p>“Did you set the fire?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“I sure did, lad. But don’t git excited,” went
on Ira Small. “It ain’t goin’ to do the old
<i>Hildegarde</i> much harm. All I did was to spread
some excelsior soaked in gasoline on the deck
near one o’ the rails. They kin put the fire out
easy enough. But they’ll have to work lively for
a few minutes to do it.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure it won’t burn the ship so
she’ll sink?” questioned Fred, anxiously.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t want to leave those men to
drown,” added Randy.</p>

<p>“No sech luck, lad. You can’t drown a rascal
who’s meant to be hung. No, the fire’ll soon be
out. You jest watch and see. But meanwhile,
we want to git as fur away from the schooner as
possible. Now those rascals have got an idee
they kin hold you fur a ransom, they won’t let
you escape if they kin help it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>With the motor of the <i>Fancy</i> running fairly
well, Gif and Spouter turned their attention to
bailing the craft. While this was being done
Fred and the twins stowed the food away in the
cabin and saw to it that nothing might happen
to their precious supply of water. Meanwhile,
Ralph opened one of the cans of gasoline and
emptied the contents into the supply tank of the
motor boat.</p>

<p>“There! That will carry us quite a few
miles,” he declared. “Of course, how many will
depend on what kind of weather we strike and
how the sea is running.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can be thankful it’s so warm,” said
Jack, doing his best at the wheel to make the
<i>Fancy</i> ride the waves without ducking those
aboard. “If it was as cold down here as it is
around Cape Cod, I think we’d all catch our
death of cold.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad we’re wet,” said Gif. “But I
suppose we’ve got to make the best of that.”</p>

<p>They were soon out of sight of the schooner,
save for the flames which showed them a small
part of the deck. As Ira Small had said, the
fire soon became lower and presently vanished
completely.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s out,” said Fred, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’m glad of it,” returned Randy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, I’ll bet they were scared for a few minutes,”
came from Andy.</p>

<p>“You can bet they are mighty mad at us,” was
Spouter’s comment. “You can be sure they’ll
lay the fire at our door. They’ll say we wanted
to burn the ship and drown them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’ll ever try and bring any
o’ you fellows into court about it,” chuckled Ira
Small. “You’ve got too good a case ag’in’ ’em.”</p>

<p>With the extinction of the blaze on the <i>Hildegarde</i>,
the only light anywhere around the motor
boat vanished and the Rover boys and the others
found themselves plowing along slowly and uncertainly
over the wide bosom of the Atlantic.
Overhead there were drifting clouds, and only a
few stars could be seen.</p>

<p>“P’int her a little more to starboard, lad,” advised
Ira Small, as he joined Jack at the wheel.
“I can’t give you the course direct, but I’ll do
my best.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve often steered by the stars,”
returned the young major.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did when I was on the old <i>Maria
Deggett</i>,” answered the lanky sailor. “I took
three trips in that four-master, an’ we sailed
pretty nigh to ev’ry spot on the globe. She was a
fine ship, an’ Cap’n Deggett he was one fine
man!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“Why didn’t you remain on her?” questioned
Ralph.</p>

<p>“She went ashore off the coast of Floridy in
a hurricane. She was a total wreck, an’ that
nigh broke ol’ Cap’n Deggett’s heart, an’ he never
went to sea no more. That was the trip when I
heard all about the thirteen rocks an’ the pirates’
hidden gold,” went on Ira Small, impressively.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe in that treasure?” questioned
Fred, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course I do, lad! It’s there, an’ I know
it! All I’ve got to do is to locate them thirteen
rocks.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear your yarn about it some day—when
we’re out of this trouble,” returned
Fred.</p>

<p>On leaving the <i>Hildegarde</i> behind, the boys
had only one regret, and that was that they had
not recovered any of the things stolen from them.</p>

<p>“But never mind,” said Jack, in speaking of
this. “If we ever get the chance, we’ll make
Captain Gilsen and Ferguson pay up!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and pay dearly!” added Gif. “Every
one of those fellows ought to be sent to prison.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, we got our grub for nothing—not
to mention the gasoline,” chuckled Andy.
“It isn’t much, but it’s something.”</p>

<p>Now that much of the excitement attending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the escape from the schooner had come to an
end, the boys realized that they were both wet
and sleepy. A small oil stove of which the cabin
boasted was lit, and here one after another they
made themselves as comfortable as possible.
There chanced to be just one heavy raincoat
aboard the craft, and this was passed out to
be used by the one who was on duty at the
wheel.</p>

<p>“I’ll take my trick at the wheel for a few
hours,” announced Ira Small. “That’ll give you
lads a chance to take a nap an’ dry yourselves.
The motor boat ain’t a schooner, but I reckon I
kin manage it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Ralph, gratefully. “If
anything goes wrong with the engine, just call
me.”</p>

<p>The boys retired to the cabin and there made
themselves as comfortable as the limited quarters
permitted. They hung some of their clothing
close to the oil stove and then, utterly worn out,
sank down to rest wherever a place afforded.</p>

<p>Morning found them still on the bosom of the
broad Atlantic with neither a sail nor land in
sight. The sun peeped out from behind a thin
bank of clouds, and by its rays they set their
course due west.</p>

<p>“We’re bound to hit land sooner or later,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Jack. “That is, if the good weather and
the gasoline hold out.”</p>

<p>“How many miles can we travel with the
gasoline we have on hand?” questioned Fred of
Ralph.</p>

<p>“That’s a hard question to answer, Fred. You
see, I’ve not been running the <i>Fancy</i> very long,
and I don’t know what she can make in this
sort of sea. You know it’s one thing to run in
smooth water, and quite another in the swells of
the ocean. We lose a lot of our headway every
time the stern is lifted out of the water.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope, if it doesn’t carry us to land,
that it will at least carry us in the path of the
ships sailing up and down the coast,” put in
Spouter.</p>

<p>“We’ll run straight for the first good-sized
steamer we see,” answered Ralph.</p>

<p>“Don’t run into any more rum-runners,”
warned Andy, with a sickly grin. “We’ve had
enough of that class of rascals.”</p>

<p>With the coming of daylight, the boys and the
lanky sailor felt better. A pot of coffee was
gotten ready on the oil stove and cups of this
beverage passed around with some bread and
biscuits served to make them still lighter hearted.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ve got to be careful how we
use up our grub and water,” warned Jack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
“There is no telling how long it has got to last
us. For all we know, we may be much farther
from shore than we imagine.”</p>

<p>Slowly the morning wore away. About eleven
o’clock Fred set up a shout.</p>

<p>“What is that smoke just ahead of us?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Spouter. “Looks
like some smoke on an island.”</p>

<p>“It’s a steamer!” came from Gif, a minute
later. “A steamer! And she’s moving northward.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can’t get close enough to hail
her!” cried Jack, eagerly.</p>

<p>Ralph was willing, and soon had the <i>Fancy</i>
running at her best rate of speed. Then he took
the wheel from Gif, who was steering.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can manage her a little better,” he
said. “You know, I’ve had more experience.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Ralph,” answered Gif, readily. “I
never was very much of a sailor.”</p>

<p>Then began a mad race in the direction of the
distant steamer. Would they be able to get close
enough to signal to those on board?</p>

<small>A CRASH IN THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Are we getting any closer?”</p>

<p>The question came from Randy after at least
a quarter of an hour had passed in their eager
chase after the distant steamer which was moving
slowly, leaving a long trail of black smoke
in the air behind it.</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be making much progress,”
answered Jack, dubiously. “What do you think,
Ralph?”</p>

<p>The former major of the Colby Hall battalion
shook his head while his face showed his disappointment.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she’s getting away from us.”</p>

<p>“That’s jest how it looks to me,” burst out
Ira Small. “Guess she’s one o’ them fast boats
runnin’ from South America to New York.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we make some kind of a signal to her?”
asked Fred. “Why not hang a flag out upside
down, or something like that?”</p>

<p>Several flags were stowed away in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
lockers, and now Old Glory was brought forth,
and this several of the lads took turns in waving
wildly, keeping the stars at the bottom.</p>

<p>The steamer was a goodly distance away, and
it is doubtful if a signal could have been seen
without the aid of a glass. As it was, no attention
was paid to the motor boat, and presently
the big liner passed out of sight in the distance.</p>

<p>“Good-bye to our first hope,” remarked
Spouter, mournfully.</p>

<p>“And may we have better luck next time,” said
Fred, hopefully.</p>

<p>Slowly the remainder of the day wore away.
A little after noon they prepared a dinner of
baked beans, canned corn and a few strips of
bacon, washing this down with a little more coffee.
They did not dare make very much of the
beverage because they wished to save their water
supply.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to cut out coffee altogether if we
don’t sight something to-morrow,” warned Jack.</p>

<p>Toward evening they saw a sail in the distance.
But night was coming on and the sail soon disappeared
in the darkness, and they found themselves
alone as before.</p>

<p>“Don’t look as if I was ever goin’ to see them
thirteen rocks an’ ketch sight of the pirates’
gold,” murmured Ira Small, dolefully. For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
time being his high spirits seemed to have deserted
him.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d be awfully sleepy,
Small,” remarked Jack. “Why don’t you turn
in and see if you can’t get a good night’s sleep?
You’ve had hardly a wink since the night before
we left the <i>Hildegarde</i>.”</p>

<p>“Think I will turn in, if you fellows kin git
along without me,” answered the old sailor. “If
anything unusual turns up, jest call me,” and he
retired to the cabin and was soon snoring lustily.</p>

<p>“He certainly is a character,” remarked Gif.
“But I guess his heart is in the right place.”</p>

<p>“He certainly proved himself our friend,” returned
Jack. “If it hadn’t been for him, we
might still be aboard the schooner. It would
have been useless for us to cut loose in the motor
boat without the gasoline and the grub.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is anything to his story
about the thirteen rocks and the pirates’ gold?”
questioned Andy. Tales of piratical treasure
had always appealed to the fun-loving Rover.</p>

<p>“There may be something in it, Andy. Certainly
the pirates existed. And if they got all
the loot the books tell about, they must have
either spent it or else hidden it somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but as far as I have ever heard, the great
majority of the searches for pirates’ treasures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
have been dead failures,” broke in Spouter. “I
know, only a few years ago, a company was organized
up in our neighborhood to look for a
treasure said to be buried off the coast of Brazil.
The promoters wanted my father to take stock
in the concern, but he refused. The crowd got
together and went down to Brazil in a steamer
and spent two or three months looking for the
gold, but didn’t find a single doubloon.”</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes a treasure hunt proves a success,”
said Jack. “Don’t forget how my father
and Uncle Tom and Uncle Sam went down to
the West Indies and located the Stanhope treasure.”
He referred to a great treasure search,
the particulars of which have been given in the
volume entitled, “The Rover Boys on Treasure
Isle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you told us about that, Jack,” answered
Spouter. “And I’ve heard the particulars from
my father, too. You know, he was with the expedition.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get the particulars of this treasure from
Small,” said Randy. “We might organize an
expedition just as our folks did,” he added, his
eyes glistening for the moment.</p>

<p>The boys took turns at steering the <i>Fancy</i>, and
thus the greater part of the night wore away.
Just as it was growing light in the east Fred,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
who was at the wheel, uttered an exclamation of
dismay.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Fred?” questioned
Randy, who was coming out of the cabin to relieve
him.</p>

<p>“The motor just went dead.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she’s out of gasoline. Wait a minute
till I take a look at the tank.”</p>

<p>An inspection of the gasoline tank of the craft
showed that it still contained a quart or more of
the volatile fluid.</p>

<p>“It’s in the engine, or else the battery has gone
out of commission,” said Randy.</p>

<p>Not caring to do too much to the engine without
consulting Ralph, they called the young commander
of the motor boat, and while Fred continued
at the wheel in an endeavor to head up
against the rolling billows, Ralph and Randy
commenced to hunt for the trouble.</p>

<p>The boys were still at this when, a little later,
Jack and Andy appeared.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like another storm,” said Jack,
gazing eastward anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’d say it was coming up pretty
fast,” answered Andy.</p>

<p>Before the motor could be put into commission
again the sky was overcast and the wind began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
to come in strong, irregular puffs. Then,
of a sudden, it began to rain, the big drops
splashing in every direction on the motor boat
and the rolling waves.</p>

<p>“Gee, I don’t like this!” exclaimed Ralph, as
he took the wheel from Fred. “Boys, I think
we’re in for it.”</p>

<p>Soon the waves were running much higher
than before, and the <i>Fancy</i> bobbed up and down
like a cork. It was next to impossible to make
headway in any direction.</p>

<p>“Let me help you at the wheel, Ralph,” suggested
Jack. “This is going to be something
awful—worse than that fog we ran into.”</p>

<p>“This is going to be a real storm, no mistaking
that,” answered Ralph, and his face showed his
anxiety. “We’ll be lucky if we don’t upset.”</p>

<p>The constant rolling of the <i>Fancy</i> soon aroused
Ira Small, and once awake the lanky sailor came
outside in a hurry.</p>

<p>“I was afraid of it,” he said, gazing anxiously
at the sky. “I felt it in my bones yesterday, but
I didn’t want to scare none of you lads. I was
hopin’ we could git inshore before it come.”</p>

<p>By eight o’clock the storm was on them in all
its violence. The <i>Fancy</i> pitched and tossed so
wildly that they could scarcely keep from going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
overboard, and Ralph advised that each one don
a life-preserver, of which there was a supply in
the forward locker.</p>

<p>“Good idee,” said Ira Small. “Le’s put ’em
on, by all means. They may save our lives.”
And so the life-preservers were adjusted by every
one without delay.</p>

<p>With such a storm in progress no one thought
of breakfast. For fear of fire, the oil stove had
been put out. Many of the loose articles aboard
the motor boat were either placed in the lockers
or lashed fast. But before this was accomplished
the <i>Fancy</i> hit an extra heavy wave, and
this caused some of the canned goods and two
of the bottles of water to bounce up from their
resting-place in the cabin, smash two of the windows,
and roll overboard.</p>

<p>“Gosh, this is something awful!” muttered
Spouter. “We’ll be lucky if we ever get out
of it alive.”</p>

<p>All day long the storm continued. Occasionally
the wind would let up a little and they would
have a breathing spell, for which they would be
thankful. But then the wind would blow as
strongly as before, and they would have to cling
fast with might and main while the motor boat
plunged and tossed as if every plunge might be
her last. During that time the boys and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
sailor ate a few crackers and drank a little water,
but that was all.</p>

<p>“If only some sort of sail would appear, or a
steamer,” sighed Fred, wistfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word,” groaned Gif, who was a
trifle seasick. “I’d give all I’m worth to be on
land again.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Spouter, promptly.</p>

<p>As night came on a new peril assailed them.
Ira Small was at the wheel with Andy aiding
him when, of a sudden, Ralph, who was somewhat
forward, let out a yell of alarm.</p>

<p>“Steer to the left!” he called. “Quick!
We’re running into a mass of wreckage!”</p>

<p>As quickly as possible, Ira Small turned over
the wheel of the motor boat. Then the craft
arose to the top of a wave and the next instant
crashed into several good-sized spars and some
other wreckage that floated on the water.</p>

<p>The shock was such that several of the lads
were thrown off their feet, and for the moment
all of them thought the <i>Fancy</i> was going to upset.
But Ira Small, bareheaded and with his
scant locks flying in the wind and rain, kept manfully
at the wheel, and soon the wreckage was
left behind and the <i>Fancy</i> once more rode on an
even keel.</p>

<p>“I’ll say that was some bump,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Spouter, when he could catch his breath. “Gosh,
I thought we were going to the bottom, sure!”</p>

<p>“You fellows better see if we’ve sprung a
leak,” called out the lanky sailor. “Sounded like
a bad smash to me.”</p>

<p>As well as the bobbing boat permitted, Ralph
and Jack crawled forward and made an examination
of the bow. They found a bad crack just
below the water line through which the water
was coming in a thin but broad stream.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to plug it up, somehow!” cried
Jack. “Here, take this waste! Hold it over the
hole until I can get a knife.”</p>

<p>Jack crawled back into the cabin, and soon returned
with an ordinary table knife, and with
this Ralph started to plug the waste into the crack
through which the ocean was pouring. It was
hard work, and while Ralph was at this Jack
looked for more openings. He found one on the
other side of the motor boat, a small hole into
which he presently pounded one of the bottle
corks with the hatchet.</p>

<p>“Looks bad, Ralph,” remarked the young major,
when they returned to the cockpit.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how we’re going to get through
the night,” was the doubtful reply.</p>

<p>Half an hour or more passed, and the storm
seemed to grow wilder and wilder. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
not so much rain, but the wind came in fierce
gusts that blew the spray all over the motor boat
and its occupants. To stand up was impossible,
and the lads crouched low, wondering what
would happen next. Ira Small was still at the
wheel, and now Ralph went to his assistance.</p>

<p>Suddenly something dark and menacing
loomed up before them. The next instant the
<i>Fancy</i> struck the object with terrific force. Then
the bow of the motor boat seemed to be split
into several pieces. The craft turned over, and
the next instant everybody on board found himself
struggling in the ocean.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>ALONE ON THE OCEAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The upsetting of the motor boat came so
swiftly and unexpectedly that nobody aboard had
an opportunity to save himself. All were flung
out into the dark and turbulent water and several
were hit by the object with which the <i>Fancy</i> had
collided.</p>

<p>As Jack went overboard something struck him
in the side, all but winding him. He floundered
around helplessly for several seconds, and had it
not been for the life-preserver he had donned it
is possible that he might have gone under never
to rise.</p>

<p>The force of the waves speedily separated the
boys and the lanky sailor, and when Jack was
able to comprehend what had happened he found
himself practically alone on the bosom of the
heaving ocean.</p>

<p>“Hi, fellows! Where are you?” he managed
to call out.</p>

<p>But only the wind and the slishing of the
waves answered him. Then he strained his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
to the utmost, but not a soul seemed to be in
sight. Close at hand was a short and thick spar,
and to this the young major clung mechanically.</p>

<p>His heart was filled with horror. Was it possible
that the others had either been killed by the
collision or drowned? The thought was agony,
and fervently he prayed that the others might be
spared.</p>

<p>As the spar mounted to the top of a wave,
Jack looked around again, and this time saw the
dim outline of some dark object in the hollow
just below him. Thinking it might be the wreck
of the motor boat, he struck out feebly, and
presently gained the object, to find it a mass of
wreckage, evidently a part of the forecastle or
cabin of some small sailing ship.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” came unexpectedly from the
wreckage, and Jack was delighted to recognize
the voice of his cousin Fred.</p>

<p>“It’s I—Jack!” gasped the young major, as he
held fast to the wreckage. “Are you all right,
Fred?”</p>

<p>“Got a bump on my left shoulder, but it didn’t
amount to a great deal,” answered the youngest
of the Rover boys. “Are you alone? Where
are the others?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m alone; and I don’t know where the
others are. Have you seen any of them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“I saw Gif and Spouter just as we went
overboard. But then something struck me in
the shoulder, and we became separated in the
dark.”</p>

<p>“The others can’t be far off—unless they went
down,” went on the young major. And then,
not without considerable difficulty, he managed
to pull himself up beside his cousin on the wreckage,
which formed something of a raft fifteen or
twenty feet long and about half as wide.</p>

<p>“If we only had a light,” said Fred, “maybe
we could spot some of the others. Oh, Jack,
what will we do if they’ve been drowned?” and
the tone of his voice showed his misery.</p>

<p>“It’s terrible, Fred. I hate to think about it,”
and Jack shuddered. He felt that if his light-hearted
cousins and his chums were drowned,
life would never be the same.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour dragged by dismally.
The boys could think of nothing they might do
to aid the others, and so sat close together, holding
fast to the wreckage so that, as it pitched
and tossed from the top of one wave to the next,
they would not be swept overboard. There were
occasional sheets of rain, and the wind blew as
strongly as ever, sending the flying spray in all
directions.</p>

<p>“I saw something!” cried Fred, presently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
while they were straining their eyes to pierce the
gloom around them.</p>

<p>“Where?” questioned his cousin, eagerly.</p>

<p>“There! To the left! It’s gone now!”</p>

<p>“What did it look like, Fred?”</p>

<p>“I may be mistaken, but it looked like somebody
floundering around in the water.”</p>

<p>“Let’s yell to him.” And then both boys cried
out as loudly as their exhausted condition permitted.</p>

<p>“Who’s calling? Where are you?” came
from out of the darkness, and the next instant
the two boys saw the form of somebody on the
top of a wave close at hand.</p>

<p>“Here we are—on some wreckage!” shouted
Jack. “Be careful, or you’ll get struck!”</p>

<p>“Help me! I’m almost done for!” gasped the
swimmer, and for the moment disappeared in the
trough of the sea.</p>

<p>Throwing himself flat on the wreckage, Jack
crawled to the edge. A second later he saw an
arm in the water and grasped it tightly. Then
out of the briny deep came Ira Small, spluttering
and kicking convulsively.</p>

<p>“Save me! Save me!” he groaned. “I’m all
in! I guess my right leg is broke.”</p>

<p>In that pitching and tossing sea, it was no
easy matter to haul the injured sailor on to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
wreckage. Twice he almost slipped from Jack’s
grasp, but finally he came up, and with Jack’s
aid crawled to the middle of the improvised raft.</p>

<p>“You done me a big service, lad. I’ll never
forgit it,” mumbled Ira Small, and then he all
but fainted away.</p>

<p>“Gee, it’s too bad if his leg is broken,” remarked
Fred. “And we can’t do anything for
him, either.”</p>

<p>“I guess he was about all in when he reached
the raft,” returned Jack. “Another minute, and
he would have gone down.”</p>

<p>Now that they had found one of their companions,
the two boys looked around more eagerly
than ever for the others. Time and again they
called out, and once they thought they heard a
cry in return; but from whence it came they
could not determine, and soon the whistling wind
drowned out every other sound.</p>

<p>After the rescue of Ira Small several hours
went by—hours that the boys never forgot. The
rude raft pitched and tossed as before, and while
the rain stopped, the wind blew as fiercely as
ever, showering them continually with the ocean
spray. Occasionally some small bits of wreckage
hit that upon which they rested, and once a
small spar rolled up on the raft, hitting Jack in
the foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“Some vessel must have gone to pieces either
in this storm or the storm we had before,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I hope some of the others got hold of the
wreckage.”</p>

<p>“So do I. But, Fred, this really doesn’t help
us much. We must be miles and miles away
from land; and without anything to eat or
drink——”</p>

<p>Jack did not finish what he had in mind to
say. But both his cousin and Ira Small understood.</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible situation,” murmured the lanky
sailor mournfully. “But I wouldn’t mind it so
much if only my leg wasn’t hurt. What good is
a sailor with a broken leg? No good at all!” and
he shook his head dismally.</p>

<p>He was now sitting up on the wreckage with
Fred on one side of him and Jack on the other.
All had on their life-preservers, and in addition
they clung fast to a rope which in some manner
had become tangled on the floating débris.</p>

<p>Never had the two Rover boys felt more dismal.
The mind of each reverted continually to
Andy and Randy and to their school chums.
Were the others alive? Or had they seen the
last of those they loved so well?</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! what will the folks at home say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
if Andy and Randy are drowned?” whispered
Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the doleful reply. “I’d
hate to break the news to Uncle Tom and Aunt
Nellie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and think of Gif’s and Spouter’s folks
and of the Masons!”</p>

<p>“It’s too terrible to realize, Fred. Let’s hope
for the best. It’s the only thing we can do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll go down too,” came lugubriously
from the lanky sailor. “An’ then I won’t never
find them thirteen rocks an’ the pirates’ gold.”</p>

<p>“Never mind pirates’ gold now,” returned
Jack, quickly. “I’d give every dollar of it if we
were all safe and sound on land again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, lad. I don’t doubt it. Gold
ain’t of no consequence to a man after he goes
to Davy Jones’ Locker.”</p>

<p>A little later came a moment of excitement.
Another portion of wreckage loomed up before
them, and then came a crash that all but sent
them into the ocean again.</p>

<p>“Hold fast!” yelled Jack. “But look out that
you’re not struck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my leg! My poor leg!” moaned Ira
Small, for he had been hit again, this time by
what appeared to be a piece of ship’s railing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>For several minutes the two pieces of wreckage
continued to bob up and down on the water.
They bumped, and bumped again, and finally
seemed to wedge themselves together into one
uncertain whole.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of ropes!” cried Ira Small.
“Might as well lash all the stuff together, lads.
The bigger the raft, the safer it will be for all
of us. I’d help, but I can’t do nothing with this
busted leg.”</p>

<p>Both of the boys saw the ropes he mentioned,
and set to work as best they could to lash the
two bits of wreckage together. This task took
them almost half an hour, and by that time they
were gratified to see that dawn was almost at
hand and that soon the sun would be showing itself
over the eastern rim of the ocean.</p>

<p>“I wish it was daylight,” sighed Fred.</p>

<p>“So do I,” answered the young major.</p>

<p>“Even if a ship was near by we’d be unable
to see it in this darkness.”</p>

<p>“How do you feel, Fred, worn out?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But that isn’t the worst of it, Jack.
I can’t get the others out of my mind.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I. If only—— Oh!”</p>

<p>The talk came to a sudden end as some more
wreckage hit them. All were on their guard, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
wishing to be flung overboard. But presently the
other wreckage slid away in the darkness, much
to their relief.</p>

<p>With the coming of daylight the wind seemed
to go down a little. But the waves were as high
as ever, and every few minutes those on the
wreckage found themselves covered with the flying
spray.</p>

<p>On the second bit of wreckage the boys had
found two blankets, and these they placed under
the lanky sailor, so that he might rest more comfortably.
Then Jack made an examination of
the hurt leg.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem to be broken to me,” he said.
“But it’s certainly horribly bruised. You’ll have
to be very careful of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be thankful if it ain’t broke,” was
the reply. “But it certainly hurts an awful lot.
Wish I had a drink of water.”</p>

<p>“I’d like a drink myself,” said Fred. “But
we haven’t got any water, so what’s the use of
thinking about it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity we didn’t think to save a little of
the water while it was rainin’, lad. Even a
mouthful or two might mean a whole lot to us
later on.”</p>

<p>As the sun came up over the eastern ocean,
the boys gazed eagerly in all directions. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and there they could see bits of wreckage—boxes,
barrels, floating spars, and what looked to be the
bow of a fair-sized schooner.</p>

<p>“Some vessel has certainly gone to pieces, and
not very long ago, either,” remarked Jack. “But
I don’t see anything that looks like a human being;
do you, Fred?”</p>

<p>“I see something!” cried his cousin, excitedly.
“Look over there, Jack! What is that?”</p>

<p>The young major looked in the direction indicated,
and then drew a sharp breath.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s somebody on some wreckage!” he
exclaimed. “And they are signaling to us!”</p>

<small>FACING STARVATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The fact that some of the other castaways had
been sighted filled even Ira Small with intense
interest.</p>

<p>“How many of ’em?” he queried.</p>

<p>“I can’t make out exactly,” answered Fred.
“But I think there are two, and maybe three.”</p>

<p>“I see only two,” came from Jack. “There
they go!”</p>

<p>The wreckage in the distance had disappeared
behind a big wave. But soon the Rover boys
and the sailor saw it come into view again, and
now somewhat closer than before.</p>

<p>“There are two on it—that’s all!” exclaimed
the young major. “One standing up and the
other sitting down.”</p>

<p>“Can you make out who they are?” questioned
the sailor.</p>

<p>“I think the fellow standing up is Randy, but
I’m not certain,” said Fred. And then he set
up a yell in which Jack joined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>For fully a quarter of an hour the two pieces
of wreckage bobbed up and down on the broad
bosom of the Atlantic. Sometimes Jack and
Fred thought they were coming a little closer
together, and then it looked as if they might
be drifting farther apart.</p>

<p>“It’s Randy! I’m sure of it!” exclaimed
Fred, presently.</p>

<p>“You’re right!” answered his cousin. “And
the fellow sitting down—I’m almost positive—is
Andy. He must be hurt, or he wouldn’t keep
sitting like that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he got his leg hurt, jest like I did,”
came mournfully from Ira Small.</p>

<p>At the end of an anxious half hour, the two
pieces of wreckage were not over fifty yards
apart. Jack and Fred could now see Randy and
Andy quite distinctly, and called to them.</p>

<p>“Can’t you swim over?” cried Jack. “<a href="#i_fp162">We
can’t come to you because Small is hurt.</a>”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“I’m hurt too,” answered Andy. “I got my
ankle twisted when I fell out of the motor boat.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” called the young major,
suddenly. “Maybe I can carry a line over to
you, and then we can tie the pieces of wreckage
together. We did that to another piece that
bumped into us.”</p>

<p>Taking one of the ropes, Jack saw to it that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
one end was securely fastened to the edge of the
wreckage upon which he stood. Then divesting
himself of most of his clothing, he leaped into
the ocean and began to swim with might and
main for the other improvised raft, which was
made up of part of a schooner’s stern.</p>

<p>As my old readers know, Jack had always been
a good swimmer—in fact, all of the Rover boys
could swim well—but he soon discovered that
swimming in a river or a lake was an entirely
different matter from making headway in the
rolling Atlantic. One minute he felt that he
was on the top of a high hill and the next that
he was going down into a bottomless hollow.</p>

<p>But he kept on vigorously, and soon came so
close to the other piece of wreckage that Randy
could almost reach him.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Jack,” was the warning. “If you
get struck in the head it may knock you senseless.”</p>

<p>At last, after several minutes of maneuvering,
the young major, with his cousin’s assistance,
managed to scramble up on the wreckage.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’m glad that’s over!” he panted. “It
looked like an easy stunt when I started; but it
proved to be anything but that!”</p>

<p>“Say, don’t you know a shark might have come
up after you?” questioned Andy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t think of sharks until I was half way
over,” was the reply. “And as none appeared,
there is no use of worrying about it. Is the ankle
very bad, Andy?”</p>

<p>“It’s so bad that I can’t stand on it. But never
mind that, Jack. I’m mighty glad to see you
and Fred.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about Gif, Spouter
and Ralph?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“I do not. None of us saw a thing of them
after the boat turned over.”</p>

<p>“We saw them for a few minutes,” said
Randy. “Gif had hold of a spar that I grabbed,
and Ralph and Spouter were on another piece of
wreckage. Then I slipped and went down, and
when I came up I hit this piece of wreckage and
joined Andy.”</p>

<p>It was quickly decided to bring the pieces of
wreckage together if it could be accomplished in
safety. Ira Small ordered Fred to stand by with
a small spar to use as a fender if necessary, and
then called similar directions to Randy. Then
Jack watched his chance and pulled in on the
line.</p>

<p>For several minutes matters looked rather serious
as the bits of wreckage came together with
a crash, then swept apart and came together with
another crash. But finally several pieces of rope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
were lashed fast under Ira Small’s directions,
and then Randy and Jack were able to assist
Andy to a place on the blankets beside the sailor.</p>

<p>“Now lash all the wreckage together as tight
as you possibly kin,” said Ira Small. “Then
we’ll have a purty respectable kind of a raft to
float around on. I kin tell you, this wreckage
is a God-send to us,” he went on solemnly. “If
it hadn’t been fur it, we’d all be at the bottom
of the ocean by this time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if it were not for the wreckage, the
motor boat wouldn’t have been smashed,” put in
Andy.</p>

<p>“Well, lad, I s’pose that’s so, too,” admitted
Ira Small, nodding his head gravely.</p>

<p>Now that they were together once more, the
four Rover boys felt somewhat better. Yet they
continued to worry over the disappearance of
their three chums.</p>

<p>“It will certainly be an awful thing if they
don’t show up,” remarked Randy. “Just think
of how their folks will feel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and think how we’ll feel!” came from
Fred, and his face showed his downheartedness.</p>

<p>Andy and Randy brought with them one thing
which was a little comfort. On their wreckage
they had found a piece of sail several yards
square, and during the rain they had caught a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
few cupfuls of water. From this, as the morning
wore on, each took a sip.</p>

<p>It was found that Andy’s ankle was much
swollen. The other boys bathed it for him and
then bound it up with a strip of the sailcloth.
They performed the same services for Ira
Small.</p>

<p>“We’re in the sick-bay, lad,” said the lanky
sailor dubiously to Andy. “I reckon we’ve got
to make the best of it. Howsomever, luck’s
been with us so far, an’ mebby luck’ll see us
through.”</p>

<p>Slowly the afternoon wore away. By this
time all aboard the wreckage were hungry, but
the most that anybody could offer was a water-soaked
package of chewing gum which Andy
found in a pocket of his jacket.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll find that too salty to chew,
Andy,” said Jack. “I wouldn’t touch it. It will
make you thirstier than ever.” So the water-soaked
chewing gum went unused.</p>

<p>At last night came on. So long as it was
light, everybody aboard the wreckage kept his
eyes on the alert for some sign of the other three
boys and for some craft that might pick them up.</p>

<p>“Gee, I wouldn’t care even if the old <i>Hildegarde</i>
hove in sight,” said Randy, at last. “If
we were on board that tub, we’d at least have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
something to eat and to drink and a place to
sleep.”</p>

<p>“No more o’ that schooner fur me!” cried Ira
Small. “I’d rather jump in the ocean than go
aboard her ag’in,” and his eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>When night settled down they found themselves
absolutely alone on that part of the wide
ocean. Even the bits of wreckage which had
surrounded them had disappeared. Nothing was
to be seen on every side but the heaving waters.</p>

<p>“Gosh, if we ever get off of this and on dry
land once more, I won’t want to look at the ocean
again for years,” murmured Randy.</p>

<p>“I’ll be like the fellow who got seasick and
said the next boat he’d take would be a Pullman
car,” put in Andy, with a faint grin.</p>

<p>In such a perilous position, with the wreckage
heaving up and down on the water, sleep was almost
out of the question. Occasionally one or
another would doze off, to awaken with a start
as the uncertain flooring beneath him gave an
extra lurch or an ominous crack. They did not
know whether the ropes they had used would
hold the wreckage together. If it parted, they
might at any instant find themselves again floundering
around in the ocean.</p>

<p>Before morning came, the ominous clouds began
to gather once more, and now the wind came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
up in fitful gusts. In a little while the wreckage
was bobbing up and down and creaking fitfully.</p>

<p>“If only we had a few more strong ropes,”
said Ira Small. “Those we have are good
enough if the weather stays calm, but I’m afraid
a heavy storm would prove too much of a strain
on ’em.”</p>

<p>The day proved one of alarming uncertainty.
The heavy clouds soon brought on more rain,
and the wind became almost as violent as it had
been the day before. Anxiously all of the boys
and the lanky sailor watched the ropes that held
the wreckage together.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we can get a drink out of this,
maybe,” said Randy, and he and the others spread
the canvas so that they might catch as much of
the rain as possible.</p>

<p>They swallowed the liquid eagerly. It did not
help their hunger, but it cut off that awful thirst
which was little short of maddening.</p>

<p>Thus another night was spent on the wreckage.
By this time their hunger had become acute.
Andy and the old sailor suffered the most, because
of their hurts.</p>

<p>“Gee, I can’t stand this much longer, Randy,”
said Andy to his twin, at last. “I feel as if I
was getting sick all over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Andy, that I can’t do anything
more for you,” was the brotherly response. “But
there isn’t a thing here to work with.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that! It’s not your fault, Randy,”
and Andy said no more.</p>

<p>After a little while no one seemed to feel like
talking. A gaunt spectre arose in the mind of
every one on the wreckage—the spectre of
Starvation. With nothing to eat, how much
longer could they live?</p>

<p>“Maybe we would have been better off if we
had gone down in the first place,” thought Jack.
“It’s better to die quickly than to die by inches.”</p>

<small>ABOARD THE STEAM YACHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Slowly the forenoon passed. Again all
scanned the horizon eagerly. Twice they thought
they saw sails in the distance, and once caught
sight of a trail of smoke left by some steamer.
But no craft came close enough to be signaled.
Nor did they see any more of the wreckage.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid the other fellows have gone to
the bottom,” said Fred, and his voice trembled
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, there ain’t much ch’ice between bein’
drowned an’ starvin’ to death,” came from Ira
Small. His thin face was thinner than ever and
his eyes burned with a peculiar fire.</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope Small doesn’t go crazy,” whispered
Randy to Jack. “I’ve heard some people do that
when they get too hungry.”</p>

<p>“He certainly looks pretty wild, Randy,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel a bit dizzy, Jack? I do.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying not to think of being hungry,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
said the young major. “It’s the only way out as
far as I can see.”</p>

<p>A few minutes more passed and then, of a
sudden, Ira Small leaped to his feet, pointing his
long, bony hand ahead of him.</p>

<p>“There’s another wreck!” he called out.
“Looks like a steam yacht, too!”</p>

<p>All gazed in the direction indicated and saw
that Ira Small was right. The wreck, which was
quite a distance away, disappeared in a hollow
of the ocean, but a moment later came up on
the crest of a wave.</p>

<p>It was a steam yacht, but both of the masts
were broken off just above the deck, one dangling
partly over the side, held by a number of ropes.
The bow of the yacht was smashed in, and a
goodly portion of the starboard rail had been
carried away.</p>

<p>“She’s been in a collision, that’s sure!” cried
Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe she smashed into the ship the wreckage
of which hit the <i>Fancy</i>,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>“That might be so, lad,” said the old sailor,
still standing up, in spite of his hurt leg.</p>

<p>“Let’s yell and wave our hands!” cried Andy.
“I’d rather be on a boat like that, even if she
is all battered up, than on this wreckage. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
that, we want something to eat—and mighty
quick, too!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anybody on the deck,” came from
Randy.</p>

<p>All looked eagerly toward the battered steam
yacht. The craft was of good size and tilted
over to port and up at the bow.</p>

<p>“Looks to me like the yacht had been abandoned,”
said Ira Small. “Look, lads! All the
small boats are missin’. I’ll bet after she was
struck the cap’n thought she was goin’ down, an’
so abandoned his ship.”</p>

<p>Slowly the steam yacht came closer. She was
considerably water-logged, and now the Rover
boys and the sailor saw that her bow was greatly
damaged and that part of the forward deck had
also been torn up.</p>

<p>“She must have been in a terrible smash, whatever
it was,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, and she may have cut the other boat
clean to pieces,” answered Randy. “Just look
at all the wreckage we got into!”</p>

<p>“But if she hit that boat, why didn’t we see
the yacht before?” queried Fred. “She was
right on the same spot.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must remember, this here wreckage
is from a small sailin’ ship,” answered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
lanky sailor. “That there yacht probably has a
good engine aboard, and maybe after the collision
the cap’n put on full steam, thinkin’ he
could make land. Then the vessel got so water-logged
he was afraid she was goin’ down, and
so he and his crew and his passengers, if he had
any, took to the boats. But I want to say one
thing,” he went on impressively: “She’s the
funniest lookin’ steam yacht I ever saw. Look
at that queer house on deck, and look at them
queer portholes along the side. Maybe she’s a
hospital ship.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could get aboard to find out,” came
from Andy. His hunger was making him desperate.</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to try to swim over to her,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“If you go, I’ll go along,” answered Randy,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you try it, each of you’d better take
two life-preservers,” suggested Ira Small. “Then,
when you git tired of swimmin’, you kin rest
yourselves. It ain’t no mean distance to that
there vessel. Distances on the water are mighty
deceivin’.”</p>

<p>“What about sharks?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to run that risk,” answered Jack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
“I’d just as lief be food for sharks as to starve
to death,” he added desperately.</p>

<p>A little later, each wearing two life-preservers,
Jack and Randy struck out for the water-logged
steam yacht, which was moving slowly on the
rolling bosom of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry, Randy,” cautioned the young
major. “It may be a long swim, and there is
no use of our getting winded. Take it easy.
It may get us there quicker in the end.”</p>

<p>The two Rover boys made slow progress, and
at the end of a quarter of an hour the water-logged
steam yacht seemed to be almost as far
away as ever.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as if we were going to make
it, does it, Jack?” questioned his cousin, as he
stopped swimming for a moment. His looks
showed his disappointment.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get there sooner or later,” Jack answered,
as cheerfully as he could.</p>

<p>They resumed their swimming, and a few minutes
later saw, to their delight, that the rolling
ocean was bringing the strange vessel closer to
them.</p>

<p>“Look out that you don’t get struck!” cried
Jack, when the steam yacht loomed up just ahead
of them. “She’s bobbing around pretty lively,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
in spite of being water-logged. Try to grab one
of those ropes on the broken mast.”</p>

<p>As the two youths drew closer they could hear
the swash of the ocean as it struck the sides of
the water-logged boat. But mingled with these
sounds came others that made them look at each
other in wonder.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose that noise is?” questioned
Randy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe some people in distress.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the steam yacht is a hospital ship,
as Small said.”</p>

<p>The strange noise continued to come from the
water-logged steam yacht, but what it could be
the boys could not surmise. As the vessel surged
closer, each caught hold of the ropes which held
the broken mast and then did his best to pull himself
up to the slanting deck above.</p>

<p>“Be careful!” called out Randy. “These
ropes may give way and let us and the mast down
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve held so long, I guess they’ll hold
a little longer,” answered Jack. “Up you go!”</p>

<p>A minute later the two Rover boys stood on
the deck of the water-logged vessel. The craft
was so badly listed that they moved around with
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“Not a soul in sight, dead or alive,” murmured
Jack, after they had gazed up and down the long
deck.</p>

<p>“Do you notice anything funny in the way of
a smell?” questioned his cousin, suddenly.</p>

<p>“I certainly do!” Jack gave a sniff. “Smells
something like a stable.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s a cattle boat.”</p>

<p>“That might be, Randy. But come on, we
might as well take a look around and see if anybody
is in charge. And we want to see, too,
what we can do about getting the others on the
wreckage aboard.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find some kind of small boat.
They may not have taken all of them,” was the
hopeful response.</p>

<p>Not only did the deck slope at a dangerous
angle, but it was also exceedingly slippery, so
that it was with great difficulty that the boys
managed to move around. It had been the foremast
that hung by the board, and they had come
aboard close to where rested the remains of the
smashed-in bow.</p>

<p>“There is that noise again!” exclaimed Randy,
while they were moving amidships. “What in
the world can it be!”</p>

<p>“Some animals, I guess,” answered his cousin.
“They may have some horses or cows or sheep,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
or something like that, on board. Come on, let’s
investigate. This thing is getting on my nerves.”</p>

<p>The cousins moved with caution to the middle
portion of the yacht. Here were the remains
of a deckhouse, smashed flat by the fall
of the mainmast, which was now missing. Behind
this was a cabin, the door and windows of
which were all tightly closed.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello!” yelled Jack, at the top of
his lungs. “Anybody on board? Hello!”</p>

<p>Jack had scarcely uttered the call when from
below the deck came a pandemonium of sounds
that fairly made the two lads jump. There were
roars and moans, and a shrill chattering that
made their hair feel as if it would stand on end.</p>

<p>“My stars, Jack! what kind of a boat is this?”
gasped Randy, as he clutched his cousin by the
arm.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the short reply, and Jack
looked at his cousin curiously. Had their extreme
hunger and thirst affected their minds and
were they simply imagining things?</p>

<p>They looked back to the wreckage they had
left, and to their satisfaction saw that it was
less than half as far away as it had been when
they had left it to swim over to the steam yacht.</p>

<p>“Thank fortune, it’s coming this way!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
breathed Randy. “I hope it does—that may save
us a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Provided we want to stay aboard this ship,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean by that? Don’t
you think it’s safe?” asked his cousin, in alarm.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think, Randy. Either
we’re bewitched, or this boat has got the queerest
cargo aboard I ever heard of. Just listen to
that roaring and moaning and chattering! Did
you ever hear anything like it in your life?”</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Can’t you throw us a line?” came
suddenly from the wreckage, and now they saw
that it was floating still closer.</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can’t tie fast to the wreckage
before we do anything else,” said Jack. “We
don’t want it to float off on the other side of the
yacht.”</p>

<p>Their fears forgotten for the moment, the two
cousins set to work and soon found a long line
which might answer their purpose. They cast
this line out as far as they could, not once, but
many times, and at last had the satisfaction of
seeing it caught by Fred and the old sailor. Then
to the light line they attached a fair-sized hawser,
and this was speedily hauled down to the wreckage,
which in a few moments more bumped into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
the side of the steam yacht and was secured
there.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’m glad to be over here!” cried Fred.
“Hurry up! Help me get Andy and Small
aboard. Is there anybody alive on the yacht?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know what’s aboard yet,” answered
Jack, anxiously. “We’re hearing all sorts of
strange sounds. Just listen!”</p>

<p>All listened, and suddenly the face of Ira Small
took on a knowing look.</p>

<p>“By gum! I know what this craft is,” he
exclaimed. “I’ve heard of her before. She’s
a menagerie ship!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>ANIMALS, BIRDS AND SNAKES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“A menagerie ship?” queried Randy.</p>

<p>“That’s it, lad. Those must be wild animals
you hear. An’ mebby some monkeys,” added
the lanky sailor, listening to the roaring and chattering.
“Are any of ’em loose?”</p>

<p>“So far we haven’t seen anything that’s alive,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well go aboard,” called
Andy. “If there are any wild animals loose,
though, I don’t know what we’re going to do.”</p>

<p>The wreckage was pounding so hard and constantly
against the side of the steam yacht, nobody
cared to remain upon it, and so with all the
care possible Andy and the old sailor were helped
to the deck above, and then Fred followed them.</p>

<p>“Better not cut the wreckage loose just yet,”
advised Jack. “We may want to get on it in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“Gee! do you think those wild animals might
get loose and chase us around?” questioned Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think, Fred. We
haven’t had a chance to look the boat over. I
guess the best thing we can do first is to arm
ourselves.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to find anything in the
way of clubs, because the storm had swept the
deck of the steam yacht almost clean. But they
finally managed to break out some pieces of wood
from the wreckage at the bow, and from these
made a number of heavy sticks.</p>

<p>“You two had better stay near the ladder leading
to the roof of the cabin,” said Jack to Ira
Small and Andy. “Then, if there’s any trouble,
you can climb up there somehow to safety.
There is no use of staying down on the deck
with those game legs of yours.”</p>

<p>The two injured ones did as advised, and then
the others moved around cautiously to the cabin
door. Opening it inch by inch, Jack peered into
the compartment to find it deserted.</p>

<p>“Nothing here!” he exclaimed, and walked
into the cabin, followed immediately by Fred and
Randy.</p>

<p>The place was in great disorder, showing that
those aboard the steam yacht had evidently left
in a hurry. Lockers stood wide open, much of
the contents strewn in all directions. On the
floor lay a number of dishes along with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
knives, forks and spoons, evidently swept from
the cabin table by the hurry of those who were
escaping from the vessel or by the action of the
storm. Around the cabin were a number of
staterooms, some of the doors of which stood
wide open, and here the same disorder prevailed.</p>

<p>“I suppose they didn’t have much time in which
to leave,” was Jack’s comment. “They probably
grabbed what they could lay hands on and ran
for the boats.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything to eat around here!” exclaimed
Fred. “Let’s find the cook’s galley.”</p>

<p>“Here’s some drinking water, anyhow,” came
suddenly from Randy, as he caught sight of a
cooler on a stand at the end of the cabin.</p>

<p>The cooler was almost full, and the three lads
lost no time in getting all the water they wanted.
Then they picked up a pitcher from the floor and
filled this, and Fred took it to Andy and the
lanky sailor.</p>

<p>“Gosh, that tastes like heaven!” said Ira
Small, as he smacked his lips. “Now if I had
a bite to eat, I think I’d feel like a new man.”</p>

<p>“You never know how good water is until you
have to do without it,” remarked Andy.</p>

<p>Having assured themselves that there was no
cook’s pantry attached to the cabin, the three
boys came out on deck again, and then went on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
a hunt for the cook’s galley. This was soon located,
and much to their satisfaction they came
upon a quantity of food which made their eyes
sparkle in anticipation. There were all sorts of
canned goods, both fish and meats as well as
vegetables, and in addition boxes of crackers,
sides of bacon, and canisters of tea, coffee, cocoa,
and also salt, sugar, rice and a great variety of
other articles.</p>

<p>“We can’t cook anything on that stove—at
least not the way it’s standing,” said Randy,
pointing to the tilted-up kerosene stove of which
the galley boasted.</p>

<p>“I am hungry enough to eat a cold meal,”
came quickly from Fred, who was already munching
a cracker. “Come on, let’s take some of this
stuff to Andy and that sailor. They’re just as
starved as we are.”</p>

<p>With their hands full of good things, the
three boys made their way to the top of the
cabin, and soon the whole crowd were regaling
themselves with the first meal they had eaten for
several days. They broke open several cans of
soup, and though the soup was cold, it tasted
better to them than any meal they had ever
eaten.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what—hunger is the great sauce,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
declared Jack, as he munched his sixth cracker.
“At home we’d probably turn up our noses at
this, but here—wow!”</p>

<p>While they were eating they discussed the situation,
but could arrive at no conclusion as to
what would be their next best move.</p>

<p>“We can’t do much of anything, lads, until we
have examined the ship,” declared Ira Small.
“For all we know, she may be leakin’ so fast that
she’s liable to go down at any time.”</p>

<p>“In that case, the best thing we can do is to
put a supply of grub and water on the raft and
make the raft as substantial as possible,” cried
Andy.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be no bad idee, lad. That
wreckage did us a mighty good turn. We kin
lash all the timbers together with a few more
ropes, an’ git some kind of a spar for a mast, an’
then hoist a sail if we have to leave the yacht.
But examine the ship first—it might not be so
bad after all.”</p>

<p>The thought that the steam yacht might go
down suddenly filled the Rovers with a new
dread, and in spite of the old tar’s last words,
they decided to pack a lot of the ship’s stores in
some sailcloth, the bundle being then hung over
the side where it could be lowered to the wreckage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
without much trouble. Then they found a
cask filled with drinking water, and placed this
near the rail.</p>

<p>“Now if the worst comes to worst, we’ll have
something to rely on,” declared Jack. “I don’t
think she’ll go down so fast but what we’ll have
time to get that stuff aboard the wreckage. Then
we can take a lot of ropes along and other things
and fix the raft up after we’ve shoved off.”</p>

<p>Having eased their minds about the food and
the water, Jack, Randy and Fred continued their
inspection of the yacht.</p>

<p>“I’m rather afraid to go below on account of
what may be loose down there,” said Fred.</p>

<p>They found a door, and beyond this there was
a sort of runway, or gangplank, leading to the
deck below. As the ship was on so much of a
slant, it was no easy matter for the boys to get
down, and they advanced with caution, Jack
holding up before him a ship’s lantern he had
found and lit.</p>

<p>The smell of wild animals was powerful below
decks, and the sounds they had heard above were
now increased tenfold. Close at hand were a
number of empty stalls, or cages. But presently
they came upon one cage containing a live tiger.
Farther on were several more tigers and also
four lions. Then came a number of leopards and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
other wild beasts, some of which the boys were
unable to identify.</p>

<p>This was on the upper side of the vessel. On
the lower side were two cages of monkeys, three
of parrots, and several heavy wire cages the occupants
of which made the boys draw back in a
hurry.</p>

<p>“Snakes!” cried Fred, in disgust. “What do
you know about that? Great big snakes!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and look at the number of them!” returned
Randy. “There must be fifteen or more.
Just look at that big brown thing! He’s as thick
as my arm and at least ten feet long.”</p>

<p>“This certainly is a menagerie ship, and no
mistake,” came from Jack, and then he added:
“I suppose those poor beasts haven’t had anything
to eat or drink since the crash came. We
ought at least to give them some water.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a hogshead full of water,” said Fred,
“and half a dozen pails. We might as well give
them a drink while we’re at it.”</p>

<p>The hogshead, even though on a slant, was
more than half full of water, and into this the
lads dipped the pails, and soon all of the animals
were supplied. At once they stopped their roaring
and growling, and set about satisfying their
thirst.</p>

<p>In another part of the ship the boys discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
a dozen sheep and goats, and also a cage of
live rabbits. In a closet they discovered many
canisters of crackers which were not unlike dog
biscuit, and they rightly guessed that these were
food for the monkeys. There were also several
kegs of grain for some birds which hung suspended
in a row of cages, and for the parrots.</p>

<p>“I suppose those live rabbits must be for the
snakes,” said Jack. “You know, such reptiles
won’t eat anything dead.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I want to feed any
snakes rabbits,” said Randy, making a wry face.</p>

<p>They had soon fed the birds and the monkeys.
Then, as there seemed no help for it, they slaughtered
one of the sheep and threw portions of the
carcass to the various wild animals.</p>

<p>“I hate the job,” was the way Jack expressed
himself. “But I can’t leave those beasts to starve
to death. They probably suffer as much from
hunger as we did.”</p>

<p>The boys had opened several of the portholes
of the lower deck, so that the breeze, coming in,
made the air below much sweeter. Yet it was
not a pleasant place to be in, and they were glad
when the last of the animals and the birds had
been taken care of.</p>

<p>“Now we’d better get down in the lower hold
and see what condition the ship is in,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Jack. “According to Small, we should have done
that in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Randy. “Just the same,
I’m glad we took care of those animals and birds.
That awful growling and moaning and chattering
got on my nerves.”</p>

<p>Looking around once more to see that all of
the things which were alive below decks had been
properly cared for, the three lads advanced to the
runway down which they had come from the deck
above. They were just about to start up the
runway when Randy uttered a scream of horror.</p>

<p>“Look out, there!” he called. “Look out, or
he’ll be after you!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” came simultaneously from the
other Rover boys.</p>

<p>“A snake! One of those big snakes!” was the
reply. “He’s at the top of the runway! There
he goes out on deck!”</p>

<small>FRED’S LUCKY THROW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The three Rovers were alarmed, and with good
reason. Such a snake at liberty on the deck of
the water-logged steam yacht would be a constant
source of danger.</p>

<p>“Are you positive you saw him, Randy?” questioned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Positive!” was the ready reply. “Gee, but
he was a big one, too!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better warn the others,” broke
in Fred. “That snake may go right after Andy
or Small if they happen to be down on the deck.”</p>

<p>“I’m going out, snake or no snake!” came from
the young major.</p>

<p>“Wait! Let’s get those hatchets and axes we
saw back there,” cried Fred, and ran back, to return
a minute later with two axes and a fair-sized
hatchet.</p>

<p>Carrying these weapons ready for use, the three
Rover boys mounted the runway cautiously. At
first they saw nothing on the deck. Then Fred
pointed excitedly to the wreckage at the bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“There he is!” he cried. “There he goes
under those boards!”</p>

<p>“What are you yelling about?” came from
Andy. He and the lanky sailor were still resting
on the top of the cabin.</p>

<p>“It’s a big snake,” answered Jack. “He got
loose and just came up a runway. There are a
whole lot of them down below, in a big wire
cage.”</p>

<p>“If we only had guns we could take a shot at
that snake!” exclaimed Randy. “I’m sure we
could soon blow him to pieces.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take a shot of another kind!”
exclaimed Fred, and, aiming as carefully as he
could, <a href="#i_frontis">he threw the hatchet with all the force
he could command</a>.</p>

<p>It was a light and sharp affair, and as the
bright steel circled through the air the boys saw
the snake twist around and for a moment its head
came into view. Then the circling hatchet descended,
cutting the snake deeply in the center
of its body.</p>

<p>“You struck him, Fred!” exclaimed Randy, in
delight.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he isn’t dead,” announced Jack,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Look out! He may come for you!” came
from Andy, who could see the reptile from where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
he was resting. And now in his excitement he
stood up, and Ira Small did likewise.</p>

<p>The wound made by Fred’s hatchet was evidently
a severe one, and, maddened with pain,
the reptile whipped around and around on the
forward deck. Then, of a sudden, it began to
slide down the slope, and a moment later disappeared
over the side of the yacht into the heaving
ocean.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” murmured Randy, in awe-struck
tones.</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’m glad of it,” answered Jack.
“Fred, that was certainly a dandy throw.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say it was a lucky one,” answered the
youngest Rover boy modestly. His face had
blanched and he was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>“For all we know, there may be more loose
snakes around,” remarked Jack. “We’ll have to
be on our guard every minute.”</p>

<p>“I move we look around the cabin for guns
and pistols,” said Randy. “I’d feel a good deal
better if I had some sort of firearm. It would
be a protection, not only against the snakes, but
against those wild beasts, if any of them should
break loose.”</p>

<p>“If I had my way, I’d heave all the beasts and
the snakes overboard,” came from Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>He armed himself again with the hatchet, and
then the three boys rejoined Andy and the lanky
sailor, and the five held a consultation.</p>

<p>“The steam yacht don’t seem to be settlin’ very
fast,” said Ira Small. “So I don’t know but
what your idee of lookin’ round for some
weapons ain’t a first-class one. I’d like to have
some kind of a shootin’ iron myself. A bullet
travels a heap-sight quicker nor a club, or a
hatchet, either. Not but what that crack of
yours, lad, wasn’t a wonder,” he added hastily to
Fred.</p>

<p>Without delay Jack and his two cousins re-entered
the cabin and made a thorough search
of that compartment and the staterooms adjoining.
They kept their eyes open for more reptiles,
but none appeared. In one stateroom they
found a case containing two automatic pistols,
and on a rack in another stateroom they found
two double-barreled shotguns. All of the weapons
were loaded; and they also found some extra
ammunition.</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’ll feel better,” said Jack, after
Fred and Randy had appropriated the pistols and
he had armed himself with one of the guns.
“I’ll take this other gun up to Andy and Small.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another pistol!” exclaimed Fred, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
looked into a drawer under one of the stateroom
beds. “It’s a small affair, but it looks to
be all right and it’s fully loaded.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give that to Andy and that old sailor
can take the shotgun. Then each of us will have
a weapon.”</p>

<p>In one of the staterooms they had also found
a good-sized flashlight, and this Jack placed in
his pocket.</p>

<p>“I suppose we really ought to go down in the
lower hold and find out how badly she is leaking,”
he said. “Do you feel like going with
me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel very much like it, Jack,” answered
Fred, candidly. “But I suppose it ought to be
done. We’ll take our weapons and the flashlight,
and then maybe we’ll be safe. I don’t believe
any wild beast would want to charge us with that
light flashing into his face.”</p>

<p>The boys soon located the engine room of the
steam yacht, and there found a ladder leading
down to the lower hold, which was, as they later
on found, connected with the upper deck by several
hatchways, all of which had been battened
down during the storm.</p>

<p>They found the hold divided into several compartments.
Most of the doors of these compartments
were closed and bolted. There was a miscellaneous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
cargo of boxes, crates and barrels, all
thrown into hopeless confusion, caused by the
listing of the vessel.</p>

<p>“She has not only settled on her port side, but
she’s also settled at the stern,” said Jack. “That’s
why the smashed-in bow is sticking so high in
the air. There doesn’t seem to be any great
amount of water forward, not over a foot at the
deepest.”</p>

<p>With caution the boys climbed to the stern of
the steam yacht, and there found the water in
one place to be two and a half feet deep. They
looked at it carefully and threw the searchlight
on all sides, but could not bring themselves to believe
that the water was becoming perceptibly
higher.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think?” said Jack, at
last. “I think the only opening is at the bow,
and the only water that’s coming in now is what
we’re shipping from the rolling of the waves.”</p>

<p>“Then what makes the vessel sink at the stern?”
questioned Fred. “Why didn’t she sink at the
bow and go down?”</p>

<p>“I can’t answer that question, Fred. Maybe
they shifted some of the cargo in an endeavor to
get the hole up above the water line. Anyway,
that’s how the thing is now, and I believe if we
could get that hole closed in some way, she’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
float for a long time. I’m going to ask Small
about it; he knows more about ships than we do.”</p>

<p>The boys reported to Andy and the lanky sailor.
Ira Small was greatly interested, and said it was
quite possible that the only hole might be at the
bow.</p>

<p>“Of course, the shock may have started a few
of the seams below the water line,” he said.
“But mebby that water comin’ in could be taken
care of by the engine, or even the hand pumps.
Anyway, it don’t look to me like she’d go down
in a hurry. But I think we ought to try and
close that there hole in the bow. It didn’t look
to be more’n four or five feet an’ we kin easy
cover that with a couple o’ tarpaulins, tyin’ ’em
fast inside as well as out. You boys jest help
me around a bit, an’ I’ll show you how it kin be
done.”</p>

<p>The next couple of hours were busy ones for
all on board the water-logged steam yacht. Even
though his ankle hurt him considerably, Andy insisted
on helping drag forward some heavy tarpaulins
which were found stowed away on the
vessel. When it came to adjusting the necessary
ropes, Ira Small performed his share of the task.
And so between all of them, two tarpaulins, one
on top of the other, were lashed fast over the
smashed-open bow of the vessel. Then Ira Small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
insisted upon going down in the forward hold to
show the boys how the inner tarpaulin could be
fastened so that little or no water could enter.</p>

<p>“Course it’s only a makeshift,” explained the
lanky sailor. “But I’ve knowed sech a makeshift
to last a long while. Now if we kin shift some
o’ that cargo, mebby we kin git her on more or
less of an even keel.”</p>

<p>“What about the water?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t touch that at present, lad. Let
it stay in the stern. It’ll keep the bow up high,
and that’s jest what we want. We’ll shut the
door to the stern hold, so the water won’t run
for’ard if the yacht begins to pitch.”</p>

<p>By the time the work was accomplished, and
Jack, Fred and Randy had prepared supper, it
was growing dark. All of those aboard the
steam yacht were exhausted from their exertions
and glad to rest and take their time at eating.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to do any more to-night,” said
Fred. “I think the best we can do is to shut ourselves
in the cabin and make ourselves as comfortable
as possible in the staterooms.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was going to suggest,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we take turns at staying on
guard?” suggested Andy. “I’m willing to keep
awake for two or three hours, and then, one after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
another, you fellows can be called to do the same.”</p>

<p>Thereupon it was decided that each person
should spend two hours on guard.</p>

<p>“If it’s all the same to you boys, I’ll take the
first watch,” said Ira Small. “I want to see if
I can’t do somethin’ with the steerin’ gear aboard
this yacht. If the rudder’s in workin’ order, I
want to see if I can’t head her up to the waves
so she’ll ride a bit easier.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right; but don’t overtax your
hurt leg,” answered Jack. “If you need any of
us in a hurry, yell or fire off the gun.”</p>

<p>Lighting the lantern in the cabin, the boys
opened the doors to the various staterooms and
then proceeded to make themselves as comfortable
as the disordered condition of the compartments
permitted. They had found quite a quantity
of clothing on board, and now proceeded to
take a rub-down and don some dry garments.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful how warm it is,” said Jack.
“I didn’t feel a bit cold even with that wet stuff
on.”</p>

<p>“We must have drifted southward,” returned
Randy.</p>

<p>The lads were all too tired to do much talking,
and having once gotten into some other underwear,
they hung their own garments up to dry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
Then, one after another, they lay down to get
what rest they could.</p>

<p>At the end of a couple of hours Jack aroused
himself, and, as his cousins were all sleeping
soundly, he went outside to see how matters were
going with the old sailor. He was just moving
forward on the deck when he saw a dark shadow
slinking along in the starlight.</p>

<p>The discovery filled him with alarm, and he
stood stock still. Then the shadow took shape,
and in another moment he saw that the object
was a tiger!</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>AN ENCOUNTER WITH A TIGER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For the moment Jack’s heart seemed to stop
beating. The tiger looked to be young but powerful,
and had evidently broken from his cage in
a search for food. He was sniffing his way along
the deck, pausing every second or two to gaze
around suspiciously.</p>

<p>The young major had one of the pistols with
him, and he wondered if that weapon would be
powerful enough to slay the beast. He knew
that a tiger is usually hunted with a heavy rifle.</p>

<p>The beast continued to slink along in the semi-darkness,
and now Jack saw that he was headed
for the pilot house, where Ira Small sat nodding
over the wheel. Evidently the beast had scented
the sailor and was wondering if he could bring
down his prey. Having had only a small portion
of food, Jack fancied the tiger might take a
desperate chance in an endeavor to satisfy the
cravings of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Hi, there, Small!” he yelled at the top of his
lungs. “Look out for yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” stammered the lanky sailor,
straightening up suddenly and turning back from
the wheel.</p>

<p>“A tiger! Look out for him! Have you got
your shotgun?”</p>

<p>As Jack uttered the words the beast turned,
and without waiting further the young major
fired two shots in rapid succession. One took
the tiger in the hind quarter and the other just
grazed his neck. The beast gave a wild leap and
then whirled around to locate the unexpected
attack.</p>

<p>Jack did not hesitate to retreat, and with all
possible speed. Dashing up the sloping deck of
the yacht, he gained the rail and there balanced
himself against a boat davit. The tiger saw him
and crept forward a few yards, crouching low as
if meditating an attack.</p>

<p>Bang! It was the report of Small’s shotgun,
and the charge hit the deck directly behind the
tiger, some of the shot entering his tail and his
hind feet. With a wild roar the beast whirled
around, and in excitement slid along the deck.</p>

<p>As he slid along the deck Jack fired again, this
time hitting the beast squarely in the side. Again
came a roar and a savage snarl, the tiger baring
his glistening teeth as if willing to chew his attackers
to bits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“Is he hit?” came from Small, hobbling forward.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he isn’t dead,” answered Jack.
“Give him the other barrel.”</p>

<p>Again the shotgun blazed forth, and this time
the charge entered the tiger’s neck and forequarter.
He straightened up, and then, seeing Jack
on the rail, made a savage leap in that direction.</p>

<p>As the beast came on, the young major fired
once more. It was at close range, and the bullet
found its way directly into the open mouth
of the tiger. The spring came to a sudden halt
and the beast dropped limp half over the rail and
within three feet of where the young major was
standing. Then the tiger gave a convulsive
shudder, dropped to the deck, and slid down the
slope against the broken-off end of the mainmast.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” questioned Small, coming from
the pilot house gingerly.</p>

<p>“I think so, but I’m not sure,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“What’s all the shooting about?” called another
voice, and Randy appeared, followed by
Fred, the first carrying a shotgun and the other
a pistol.</p>

<p>“One of the tigers broke loose and we’ve been
shooting at him,” answered Jack. “There he is—over
by the mast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“A tiger!” exclaimed Randy. He grabbed the
shotgun tighter. “Is he dead, or shall I give him
another shot?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s done for,” answered Jack. And
when they turned the searchlight on the beast,
they saw that he had breathed his last.</p>

<p>“Well, this is certainly the dog’s suspenders,”
murmured Fred. “Are there any more of those
beasts loose?” he went on nervously.</p>

<p>“You know as much about it as I do,” answered
the young major. “I suppose the others
can get loose just as well as this one did. This
is certainly a fine wreck to be on!” he added,
with a grim smile.</p>

<p>By this time Andy was hobbling up on deck.
All of the crowd, including the lanky sailor, surveyed
the tiger carefully, but with great respect.</p>

<p>“He certainly was a beauty,” remarked Jack.
“And see what a peculiar color.”</p>

<p>“I think the animals are all very fine,” answered
Randy. “Perhaps this isn’t an ordinary
menagerie ship. Maybe the people in charge
were only picking up unusual specimens.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do—heave that beast
overboard?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“No sense in doing that,” answered Jack,
quickly. “We slaughtered one of the sheep to
feed the other beasts; now I guess we can skin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
this and cut up the carcass for more food; and
maybe we can even try a tiger steak—that is, if
we can get the stove to working,” he went on.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that all of the crowd were
rather nervous for the remainder of the night.
While one was at the wheel trying to steer the
water-logged yacht, another remained on guard
at the entrance to the cabin, so that no wild beast
might gain admittance.</p>

<p>When day dawned the first work of the boys
and the old sailor was to make sure that the other
animals and the snakes were well secured. Then
the beasts, reptiles and birds were fed, after
which, leaving Andy in charge of the wheel and
on the lookout for a possible sail, the others went
below, to make an effort to shift some of the
cargo so that the water-logged steam yacht might
ride on more of an even keel.</p>

<p>But they soon found this task almost impossible.
The fire was out under the boilers, so that
the engine of the yacht could not be started, and
consequently they could not use any of the hoisting
machinery.</p>

<p>“And we can’t do much with that cargo by
hand,” declared Jack. “We’d only break our
backs and maybe get our fingers smashed. It
would take a gang of heavy laborers several days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
to make an impression down here.” So the task
of shifting the cargo was abandoned.</p>

<p>They looked over the store of provisions and
brought up a number of boxes and crates which
contained things they thought they might use.</p>

<p>“With the yacht so terribly listed, it’s out of
the question to start a fire under the boilers and
get things to running,” declared Jack. “Everything
is so out of kilter we might end by blowing
the yacht up. I guess about the only thing we
can do is to drift along and wait for somebody
to pick us up.”</p>

<p>“If there was only some sort of radio on
board!” sighed Randy.</p>

<p>“There is a receiving set in the yacht’s office,”
answered Fred. “But it doesn’t seem to be in
workable condition. Probably it was knocked
out of kilter in the collision.”</p>

<p>That day the boys managed to get the fire
started in the cook’s galley, and for the first time
in a number of days all enjoyed a cooked meal.
If a few of the articles of food were underdone
or a bit burned, nobody complained. They took
their time over the repast, and ate as they had
never eaten before.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, not a sail of any kind
had appeared in sight. And even a trail of smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
that might indicate a distant steamer was missing.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’re out o’ the track o’ most ships,”
was the way Ira Small expressed himself.</p>

<p>“If we only had the means to send out a radio
call for assistance, it might be worth while to
try to get our latitude and longitude,” said Jack.
“But that’s of no consequence while we have no
radio and no means of sailing the steam yacht in
any direction.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon the boys made another
inspection of the water-logged steam yacht, which
was named the <i>Coryanda</i>. From records on
board they learned that the craft was owned by
two scientists, Paul and James Ellingham, of
Baltimore. The Ellinghams, it seemed, were
much interested in the collecting of rare beasts,
birds and snakes, and the specimens on the steam
yacht had been picked up in various parts of the
globe after a tour lasting over two years. Each
animal, reptile and bird was carefully catalogued.</p>

<p>“Some valuable cargo, I’ll say,” declared
Randy. “Just look here! A white and red
parrot put down as worth two hundred dollars!
I wouldn’t give ten dollars for the best parrot
going.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and look here! One blue-headed snake
with a mile-long name put down at two hundred
and seventy-five dollars!” cried Fred. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
wouldn’t give that much for a boatload of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re probably worth that, and more,
to some zoo,” declared Jack. “Just the same,
I’d rather not have such things on the <i>Coryanda</i>
while I’m aboard.”</p>

<p>The afternoon wore away slowly, and toward
night Ira Small announced that another storm
was approaching.</p>

<p>“An’ it’s comin’ up fast, too,” he declared.</p>

<p>“What do you think it will do to us, Small?”
questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“There’s no tellin’, lad,” answered the lanky
sailor. “But when a ship is as water-logged as
this here <i>Coryanda</i> is, she’s liable to do most anything.
The best we kin do is to fix up that raft
of ours as good as we possibly kin and git together
all the provisions and water we kin carry.
Then, if the worst comes to the worst, we kin
leave the yacht.”</p>

<small>THE DOOMED SHIP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As Ira Small had predicted, the storm came
up rapidly, and by sundown the sky was heavily
overcast and the wind was blowing freely.
Then came a shower of rain, the wind sweeping
it furiously into the faces of those on the yacht
as they moved around, trying to get together
whatever they thought might be of benefit if they
had to take again to the wreckage.</p>

<p>Jack, Randy and the old sailor had worked on
the wreckage for over an hour, lashing the
timbers together with half a dozen ropes and
building a small platform in the center so that
they might rest more comfortably than they
had before.</p>

<p>“If only we would strike land!” sighed Andy,
who, like Small, was now limping around despite
the fact that his ankle was still swollen.</p>

<p>By midnight the storm was on them in all its
fury. The <i>Coryanda</i> pitched and tossed in the
darkness, the wreckage at her side banging and
pounding at every rise and fall of the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, maybe that raft will knock a hole in our
side!” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to do about it, and
neither does Small,” answered Jack. “We can’t
afford to cut it loose, and it might be too dangerous
to try to tow it; the line might snap, and then
we’d have nothing to take to if the yacht went
down.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad if we all go down,” murmured
Ira Small, mournfully. “I always did hope I’d
live long enough to find them thirteen rocks an’
git a chance to hunt for that pirates’ gold.”</p>

<p>The wind had been rising steadily until now it
was blowing with hurricane proportions. The
boys and the old tar did what they could to
steer the yacht so that she might head up to the
waves. But the water-logged condition of the
craft was against her, and often they hit a mountain
of water with a resounding crash that
threatened to smash all the timbers beneath them.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how the vessel can stand much
more of this,” declared Randy, after a crash that
had all but sent them sprawling.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to take what comes, and that is all
there is to it,” answered Jack, trying to put on a
brave front for the benefit of his cousins. “If
she starts to go down, all we can do is to make
a rush for the raft.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>About two o’clock in the morning they made
the discovery that the <i>Coryanda</i> was slowly but
surely settling. The force of the elements had
torn away one corner of the two tarpaulins lashed
over the hole at the bow, and into this the waves
kept pouring whenever they hit.</p>

<p>“Can’t we stop that hole?” asked Fred.</p>

<p>“No, no, lad! Don’t try it!” warned the old
sailor. “You’d be swept off by a wave before
you knew what hit you. Stay where you are,
and when she gits too low I’ll let you know and
we kin take to the raft.”</p>

<p>Another half hour passed, and then without
warning came a resounding crash on the keel of
the <i>Coryanda</i>. The vessel seemed to slide along
on something and then slid off again into deep
water.</p>

<p>“Gracious! what was that?” gasped Andy, in
new alarm.</p>

<p>“We struck a key, I think,” answered Ira
Small. “An’ if so, we must be somewhere near
land. You know, the West Indies are full of
keys of all kinds.”</p>

<p>They had the ship’s lanterns lit, and now tried
to pierce the darkness ahead with the searchlight.
But this hand instrument was too feeble to
show them anything. Then came another crash
from underneath the steam yacht, and there followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
a wild roaring, screaming and chattering
from the wild beasts and parrots below decks.</p>

<p>“Sounds as if something had broken loose
down there!” exclaimed Fred. “Gee, if they
come up here, we sure will be in a pickle!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can break out on deck
with all those doors and hatchways shut tight,”
answered Jack. Everything had been closed
with care to keep out the elements. Only the
door to the cabin was open, so that they might
enter from time to time to shelter themselves
from the fury of the hurricane.</p>

<p>One crash now succeeded another on the bottom
of the steam yacht as the vessel was driven
furiously forward by the force of the wind. The
roaring, screaming and chattering below continued,
showing that the wild beasts and birds
were in great terror and doing their best to gain
their liberty.</p>

<p>“We’re certainly among some keys,” said the
lanky sailor. “But of course, lads, you got to
remember they may not be above water. There’s
thousands of places down in the West Indies
where the keys are all beneath the surface of the
ocean. If we—— Gosh! that’s the time we
struck a big one!”</p>

<p>There had been a tremendous crash, followed
almost immediately by a bump, and then another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
bump. The <i>Coryanda</i> was thrown so far over
that every one on board lost his balance and went
sliding down almost into the water. Then the
doomed ship veered around in the wind, and, carried
by a mighty wave, swept forward to crash
again and again in the darkness.</p>

<p>“I reckon she’s goin’ to pieces!” cried out Ira
Small. “We’d better try for the raft if we kin
make it. Be careful, everybody, or somebody’ll
git drowned!”</p>

<p>As well as they could in the darkness, the boys,
led by Jack, crept down to the rail where the raft
was lashed fast. They were just going overboard
when there came another mighty crash that
threw every one of them off his balance.</p>

<p>Some struck the rail, but Randy and Fred were
hurled clear into the boiling sea. Randy went
down several feet, and so did his cousin. Blindly
each of them struck out and soon reappeared on
the top of a wave.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Fred?” spluttered Randy, as soon
as he could speak.</p>

<p>“Yes. Where are the others? Did they go
overboard?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Come on—let’s try to get on
the raft.”</p>

<p>Both raft and yacht were but a short distance
away, the lights of the latter showed dimly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
through the flying mist of the storm. Bravely the
two Rover boys endeavored to reach the raft.
But before they could move more than a dozen
feet the storm carried both boat and raft out of
their sight in the darkness.</p>

<p>“They’re gone!” gasped Fred. “The ship and
the raft are gone!”</p>

<p>The thought filled the two boys with agony,
and yet instinctively they kept swimming, hoping
almost against hope that something would
come to save them. All around were the mountainous
waves, but presently they made out a line
of foam which proved to them that some sort
of shore must be close at hand.</p>

<p>“See the foam, Fred!” gasped his cousin.
“Come on—let’s make for it!”</p>

<p>It was a struggle that neither of the lads ever
forgot. Time and again they reached shallow
water only to be sucked back by the receding
waves.</p>

<p>“I don’t think—I—can—make it!” gasped
Fred. “Oh, the—storm is something—awful!”</p>

<p>Randy was equally exhausted, and almost as
hopeless. Yet almost instinctively the two lads
continued to struggle, and presently an extra high
wave hurled them forward until their feet touched
a sandy shore. Then, before the water could
recede, they struggled onward desperately, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
at last reached a spot where the waves could no
longer touch them. Then they sank down, completely
exhausted.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the others on the doomed
steam yacht had managed to get down on the
raft. They carried their firearms and an ax and
a hatchet with them, and now Ira Small ordered
that the hawsers which held the raft to the yacht
be cut.</p>

<p>“But where are Fred and Randy?” questioned
Jack, anxiously.</p>

<p>“They went into the water. They must be
somewhere around here,” answered Andy.
“Hold up the light so they can see it.”</p>

<p>The raft was now freed from the steam yacht,
but the force of the wind still kept the two together.
Then the yacht struck again, and the
force of the collision tipped the raft up so that
those aboard were nearly spilled off into the sea.</p>

<p>“Randy! Fred! Where are you?” yelled
Andy. The possibility of his twin brother and
his cousin being drowned filled him with agony.</p>

<p>“Look out, there! Something is comin’ down
from the deck!” yelled Ira Small, suddenly.
“Lay low! Them beasts is gettin’ loose!”</p>

<p>They could see but little, for the force of the
shocks had put out nearly every light aboard
the yacht and on the raft. But they could hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
a continual roaring and snarling, and now some
of these sounds seemed to come closer. Then,
of a sudden, tawny bodies loomed up near the
yacht’s rail.</p>

<p>“It’s a lion! Two of them!” yelled Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they’re getting ready to jump down
here!” answered Andy.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>ASHORE AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It looked as if Andy was right, for both lions
now had their forepaws on the rail of the ship
as if ready to leap down on the improvised raft
and its occupants.</p>

<p>But just at that moment the keel of the <i>Coryanda</i>
struck bottom once more, and an instant
later the water-logged yacht swung around and
away from the raft. The lions were left at the
rail, and they roared savagely in their combined
perplexity and disappointment. Evidently they
knew not what should be their next move.</p>

<p>But those on the raft could give the beasts no
further consideration. The force of the hurricane
sent the bit of wreckage whirling around
and around and how the sea foamed and boiled
on every side of the raft.</p>

<p>“Hold tight!” yelled Jack to the others. “Hold
tight!”</p>

<p>Andy heeded the command. But Ira Small,
who was moving forward and for an instant had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
let go of one of the ropes, slipped to the edge
and before he recovered had disappeared in a
shower of flying spray.</p>

<p>“Small is gone!” muttered Andy, hoarsely. It
was all he could do to keep himself on the wreckage.</p>

<p>Jack did not answer. He, too, had seen the
mishap to the lanky sailor and he realized that
in such a tempest it would be next to impossible
for Small to save himself. He grabbed hold of
the loose end of one of the ropes and, tying this
fast under his arms, passed the flashlight to his
cousin.</p>

<p>“Keep this on me if you can,” he said, and
leaped overboard.</p>

<p>It was a heroic move to make, for the young
major knew that he was taking his life in his
hands. As the light shot through the flying
spray, he caught a glimpse of the hands of the
sailor a few yards away.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” yelled Small. “Throw me a
rope!”</p>

<p>“Keep up! I’m coming!” yelled Jack in return.</p>

<p>But at that instant Ira Small disappeared beneath
a mountainous wave that rolled over both
him and Jack and threatened to engulf the raft.
It was more by luck than anything else that Jack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
reached the lanky sailor even before both of them
came up to the top of the wave. Ira Small was
beating the water feebly.</p>

<p>“I—I—got a—a cramp, or somethin’,” he
spluttered. “It’s in—my legs. Save me, lad,
save me!”</p>

<p>“Hold tight, and we’ll get back to the raft!”
panted Jack. “I’ve got a rope under my arms.
Can you hold yourself?”</p>

<p>“I—guess so, although that cramp is something
terrible!” gasped the poor sailor, and Jack
saw his mouth twist in agony.</p>

<p>Another wave came along at that instant, bringing
with it the raft, to which Andy clung with
one hand while spraying around the rays of the
flashlight with the other. The light struck the
pair in the water for just a moment, and then the
fury of the hurricane sent the raft forward with
a jerk that was keenly felt by Jack. Then the
rope parted, and the young major found himself
helpless in the boiling and foaming waters with
a bit of the rope dangling under him and Ira
Small clinging desperately to his back.</p>

<p>“Kin you make it, lad? Kin you make it?”
spluttered the old tar.</p>

<p>“No. The rope broke,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Then we’re bound for Davy Jones’ Locker!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
moaned Ira Small. “Can’t you save us somehow,
lad? Kin you save us somehow? Remember
them thirteen rocks an’ the pirates’ gold.
Save me, an’ you kin have all that gold.” And
now the old sailor acted as if he were losing his
mind. He could swim but little, and the thought
of being cast away in the ocean and in the darkness
terrorized him.</p>

<p>But if Small was ready to give up, Jack was
not. Weighted down as he was by his clothing
and the rope which he could not unfasten just
then, and also by the form of the sailor, he continued
to struggle desperately in an effort to keep
afloat. Ship and improvised raft had both disappeared
in the darkness, and he could see only
a few feet in any direction.</p>

<p>He battled bravely, and wave after wave lifted
the young major and his helpless burden up and
through that boiling and foaming sea, which
denoted that land was close at hand. Then he,
like Randy and Fred, felt the sand beneath his
feet and took fresh courage.</p>

<p>“We’ve struck land!” he cried. “Hold tight
for a minute longer, Small, and I think we’ll be
all right.”</p>

<p>Another wave swept forward, carrying the pair
well up the beach. Then, watching his chance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Jack, with Ira Small still clinging to him, struggled
madly to gain some sort of foothold on the
shore.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Andy, left alone on the raft,
did not know what to do. He used the searchlight
as best he could, and when the rope suddenly
parted he retained presence of mind enough
to throw a life-preserver which was on the raft
in the direction his cousin had taken. Then the
waves and the flying spray cut out the view on all
sides of him, and though he wiped off the glass
of the searchlight and played the rays in all directions,
he could see nothing but the rolling
ocean.</p>

<p>“They are gone! All of them are gone!”
he murmured, in agony. “First Gif and Spouter
and Ralph, and now all the others! I’m all
alone!”</p>

<p>The poor boy was in such a state of mind that
he was almost ready to cast himself into the sea
and end it all. He was trying to think of what
to do when, without warning, the raft was caught
up by the waves and a few seconds later was
grounded on the beach. It went back into the
wallow of the sea, but the next wave carried it
still higher.</p>

<p>“Ashore! Ashore!” cried Andy, in amazement.
And then, before the raft could again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
slide back into the ocean, he took a flying leap
forward, landing in water less than a foot deep
and hobbled rapidly to a point of safety. As he
did this, the raft was sucked back into the ocean
and it disappeared from view into the gloom of
the night and the storm.</p>

<p>Andy had no thought of looking around to see
upon what sort of place he had landed. His
one thought was of his cousins and the old sailor.
He still held the flashlight in his hand, and now
as rapidly as he could do so, he hobbled along
the sandy beach, throwing the rays of the flashlight
before him and calling loudly.</p>

<p>The first persons he encountered were Jack
and the sailor. The young major sat on the
sands panting for breath while beside him in a
semi-conscious condition lay Ira Small.</p>

<p>“Jack!” was the eager cry. “Are you all
right?”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Andy?” panted the young major.
“Yes, I’m all right. But Small is pretty close
to being all in. When the rope parted I thought
sure we’d be drowned.”</p>

<p>“Where are the others?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Leaving the old sailor resting where he was,
Jack and Andy continued the search along the
sands. They used the searchlight, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
heard a cry from a distance, and Fred and Randy
appeared.</p>

<p>“Safe! Safe!” cried Andy, joyously. “Oh,
how glad I am! I thought I was going to be
all alone!”</p>

<p>It was a happy reunion, and for the moment the
Rover boys did nothing but hug each other in
their delight at being together again. They
cared not if the raft and the steam yacht were
gone, so long as all of them were safe. They
walked to the spot where Ira Small lay, and each
sank down to rest.</p>

<p>“He’s certainly in bad shape,” said Jack, gazing
at the old tar, who, with closed eyes, was breathing
heavily. “He said he had a cramp, or something
like that.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what place this is?” put in Randy.
“Maybe there’s some sort of village or town not
far away. If so, we might be able to get a doctor
for him. Now that we have all been saved
from the ocean, we certainly don’t want him to
pass away like this.”</p>

<p>After having rested for some time, it was decided
among the boys that the twins should remain
with the old tar while Jack and Fred set out
on a tour of exploration, taking the flashlight to
guide their way.</p>

<p>The rain had stopped entirely, but the wind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
blew as fiercely as ever, and the boys had no easy
time of it to make their way along the sandy
shore. Back of the sand they found a dense
mass of bushes and trees, a veritable semi-tropical
jungle.</p>

<p>“Gee! this doesn’t look as if there was any
village or town very near,” observed Fred, after
they had passed up and down the somewhat narrow
beach for a goodly distance. “Do you suppose
we’re on the mainland or on an island,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“I’m of the opinion we’re on an island, Fred.
It seems to me we were drifting southward most
of the time.”</p>

<p>“Would we do that if the boat was in the Gulf
Stream?”</p>

<p>“I think we were east of the Gulf Stream.
Anyway, I’ve got a hunch that we’re somewhere
in the West Indies, although, of course, I may
be mistaken. I’m really and truly all at sea,”
and Jack grinned grimly.</p>

<p>The two Rover boys walked along the beach
until they came to a point where a huge wall of
rock jutted out into the ocean, and here the flying
spray stopped their further progress. Then they
walked back along the beach to where they had
left the twins and the sailor, and then continued
their observations in the other direction. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
they found that the beach made a turn, and the
ocean came into what formed a small bay. But
at the entrance to this the jungle was so dense
that progress on foot was completely cut off.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any path around here, that’s certain,”
remarked Jack, at last. “Do you know
what I begin to believe?” he added.</p>

<p>“What?” questioned his cousin.</p>

<p>“I believe we are cast away on a small deserted
island.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>ABOUT A PIRATES’ TREASURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Morning found the five castaways resting as
comfortably as they could in the jungle on the
edge of the sandy beach. The storm had passed
completely, and only a mild wind had succeeded
the hurricane. But the waves were still angry
and foamed and boiled as they struck the keys
beyond the beach.</p>

<p>Utterly exhausted, one after another of the
Rover boys had dropped to sleep. The last to
lie down had been Jack. The young major had
found some rain water in a hollow between the
trees and bushes, and had given Ira Small a
drink. The old sailor was still suffering, but
none of the boys knew what more they could do
for him, except to place him upon as comfortable
a couch as the edge of the jungle provided.</p>

<p>It was a sorry looking crowd that came together
for a consultation shortly after the sun
arose. The boys were still wet to the skin, but as
it was comparatively warm, they did not mind
this a great deal. They hung up their jackets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
and took off their shoes and socks and thus proceeded
to dry themselves as best they could.</p>

<p>“It certainly does look lonely around here,”
remarked Fred, after taking an observation in
every direction. “Not a settlement nor a craft
of any kind in sight!”</p>

<p>“It looks like a deserted island to me,” remarked
Jack. “Or, otherwise, it’s an unusually
lonely bit of coast.”</p>

<p>Now that they had rested, all felt the pangs of
hunger. Water was to be had in sufficient quantities
for drinking purposes, but the jungle, as
far as they could see, afforded nothing in the
way of food.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, that hurricane ought to have thrown
some fish up on the beach, and maybe we can find
some oysters,” suggested Randy.</p>

<p>“Why not take a look around for the raft?”
came from his twin brother. “It got stuck for
a moment when I came ashore, and I can’t believe
but what the hurricane cast it up somewhere
around here.”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me!” groaned the lanky sailor,
propping himself up on one of his arms. “Don’t
leave me all alone in this out-of-the-way place.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to leave you, Small,” answered
Jack, kindly. “We’ll do what we can for
you, never fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“You saved my life, lad,” went on the old tar,
gratefully. “I ain’t never goin’ to forgit it,
neither. You know what I said about them thirteen
rocks and the pirates’ gold. If I ever lay
hands on that gold, you’re goin’ to git a big share
of it.”</p>

<p>“What I’d like to lay my hands on just now
is a roast-beef sandwich,” said Andy. “I feel
hollow right down to my toes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a sandwich and a good cup of hot coffee,”
put in Fred.</p>

<p>As Andy’s foot still hurt him, it was decided
that he was to remain with the sailor while the
three other boys walked down the beach in the
direction where Andy had landed.</p>

<p>For a long while the searchers found nothing
of interest outside of several small fish they discovered
flapping around in a pool well up on the
beach.</p>

<p>“There are a couple of meals, anyhow,” said
Jack. “That is, if we can make a fire to cook
them over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll make a fire all right enough. I’ve
seen it done several times, when the party didn’t
have any matches,” declared Fred. “Of course,
it isn’t very easy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we can do,” suggested
Randy. “If there are any birds around we might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
bring them down either with the firearms or with
bows and arrows.”</p>

<p>The three Rover boys continued their explorations
until almost noon, and then, to their satisfaction,
caught sight of the raft being slowly
pounded to pieces on a series of keys just outside
the tiny bay previously mentioned.</p>

<p>“There she is!” exclaimed Jack, who was the
one to make the discovery.</p>

<p>The improvised raft still hung together, and so
far as they could see their stores were still upon
it. But the sea was pounding it heavily, sending
the spray completely over it.</p>

<p>“Maybe if we had a line heavy enough we could
haul the raft ashore,” suggested Randy.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when the force of the
waves made the raft break loose from the keys
upon which it was stuck, and an instant later it
surged shoreward.</p>

<p>“It’s coming in!” cried Fred. “Let’s see if
we can’t haul it up somehow or other.”</p>

<p>The next fifteen minutes were filled with strenuous
exertions on the part of the three Rover
boys. Twice the wreckage came up on the sand,
and they did their best to hold it, but without
success. Then they managed to get hold of two
of the ropes which lashed the wreckage together,
and, watching their opportunity, they waited for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
an extra high wave and then ran the wreckage
up the beach as far as they possibly could.</p>

<p>“Now come on and tie it fast!” yelled Jack.</p>

<p>He had found a loose end of one of the ropes.
Tying this to another rope they had found on the
wreckage, they ran up the beach and anchored
the improvised raft fast to a palm tree.</p>

<p>“Now let’s get the stuff ashore before the raft
has a chance to break loose,” directed the young
major.</p>

<p>Working with feverish haste, the three boys
pitched boxes and crates and canned goods out on
the sand above the reach of the ocean. It was
well that they did this, for before they had finished
their task the wreckage began to go to
pieces. The continual pounding of the elements
had snapped a number of the ropes, and now one
bit of timber after another drifted away.</p>

<p>“Come on! Let us take the wreckage up as
high as we can get it!” directed Jack. “That
stuff may come in useful as firewood, if for nothing
else.” And so what was left of the raft was
presently hauled to a place of safety.</p>

<p>It did not take the boys long to look over the
stores, and, carrying what they needed, they hurried
back to where they had left Andy and the
lanky sailor.</p>

<p>They had matches in a water-tight box, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
soon a fire was lighted and a meal started, much
to every one’s satisfaction. After the meal Ira
Small felt better. He was not yet able to get on
his feet, stating that his legs felt too shaky; but he
insisted upon sitting up and taking part in the
discussion of what should be their next move.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’re on a little island of the West
Indies,” said the old tar. “There’s dozens an’
dozens of ’em scattered fur hundreds o’ miles
around. Most of the islands have settlements,
but there’s a lot of ’em that ain’t visited once a
year. The folks down here can’t grow nothin’
on ’em, an’ couldn’t git the stuff to market if
they did, an’ so the islands are left to themselves,
not bein’ near where ships usually travel.”</p>

<p>“Was it on one of these islands that your thirteen
rocks and the pirates’ gold was located?”
questioned Randy, curiously.</p>

<p>“That’s it, lad. An’ if I ever git my hands on
that gold, you lads are goin’ to have a fair share
of it. I ain’t never goin’ to forgit how Jack,
here, saved my life.”</p>

<p>“Tell us something about the pirates’ gold,
will you?” questioned Fred. The search and the
work of the morning had tired him completely,
and he was content to rest for a while after eating.</p>

<p>“To go into the details would be a long yarn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
lad—longer nor any of you would care to listen
to,” answered Ira Small. “Howsomever, here is
the gist of it:</p>

<p>“About five year ago I fell in with two old
sailors who hailed from Jamaica. They was
talkin’ about the thirteen rocks and pirates’ gold,
and one of ’em had several snap-shot photygraphs
of them thirteen rocks and where they
was located on an island. They said the place
wasn’t so very far from Porto Rico, an’ they
tried to figure out how to locate that island, which
they had once visited. The thirteen rocks was
located in something of a circle, an’ in the center
of it was a flat rock, an’ under that the treasure
of gold hidden by Zalopa, an old South American
pirate, and his men.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I’d like to locate that pirates’ treasure!”
murmured Fred, his eyes glistening. “What do
you suppose it’s worth?”</p>

<p>“Them old sailors thought it was worth a big
amount, although how much they couldn’t exactly
say,” answered Ira Small.</p>

<p>“Where are the sailors now?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Both dead. They got smallpox, an’ nobody
would nurse ’em but me. I stayed with ’em till
they died, an’ they was so grateful they said I
could have the treasure if I could find it. They
told me all they could about it. After their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
death I got smallpox myself, but it didn’t amount
to a great deal. I reckon I was too thin an’
leathery,” answered the lanky sailor solemnly.</p>

<p>“And you’ve never had a chance to look for
the treasure?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“Not much of a chance. You see, after I had
the smallpox I had to earn my livin’ an’ I didn’t
have no time to go treasure huntin’. But some
day, if I can git anybody int’rested, I’m goin’ to
git a ship an’ sail aroun’ lookin’ fur an island with
them thirteen rocks.”</p>

<p>“Did you save the pictures?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“I got two of ’em. The rest got tore up an’
lost. The two are sewed up in a pocket o’ my
shirt. Some day I’ll show ’em to you,” answered
the old tar.</p>

<p>It was fascinating to speculate upon a pirates’
treasure, but just at present the boys felt that
they must turn their attention to conditions as
they now existed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try to climb up one of those tall
palm trees and take a look around,” announced
Jack, a little later. “I’ve seen pictures of how
the natives go up those trees, and I’m going to
try the stunt.”</p>

<p>He took a stout rope, and, going to one of the
trees, proceeded to pass the rope around his body
under the arms and then around the tree, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
a slack of about two feet. Then, barefooted as
he was, he started to ascend the palm tree by
grasping the bark with his toes and sliding the
rope up from one point to another, bearing back
on the rope from time to time to keep it from
slipping.</p>

<p>Jack had read about this method of ascending
a tree, and had even seen a moving picture of a
native climbing in this fashion. It had looked
easy enough in the picture, but he soon realized
that ascending in this fashion was anything but
easy. However, he was determined to get up,
and after a prolonged effort managed to reach a
point where he could look around for a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” called out Randy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t see much of anything,” was Jack’s
answer. “We’re on an island. There isn’t any
settlement, and not a ship of any kind is in sight.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>A TIME OF ANXIETY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jack’s announcement filled all of those below
with keen disappointment. They had hoped from
his position in the tall palm that he would discover
either that they were on a point of the
mainland or that some sort of settlement was not
far away.</p>

<p>“Gee, we’re regular Robinson Crusoes!” declared
Andy, with a sigh. “What do you know
about that!”</p>

<p>“And not a sail in sight!” murmured Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, and nothing in the way of a boat to get
away on,” added Randy.</p>

<p>“I thought it might be that way,” put in the old
sailor. “We sure are in a pickle, an’ no mistake.
But it’s a mighty good thing you sighted the raft
an’ got them stores ashore. That food will last
us quite a spell.” And then he added suddenly:
“Don’t he see nothin’ of the <i>Coryanda</i>?”</p>

<p>“What about the steam yacht?” called up Fred.</p>

<p>“Nowhere in sight,” was Jack’s answer, after
another look around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“Then she must have gone to the bottom,”
came solemnly from the lanky sailor. “I thought
she was doomed.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one satisfaction,” was Andy’s
comment. “If she went down, it’s good-bye to
all those savage beasts and those horrible
snakes.”</p>

<p>After a careful survey of the surroundings,
Jack came down from the tree and told the others
the details of what he had seen.</p>

<p>“The island looks to be about a mile long and
not quite half a mile wide,” he said. “The western
end is mostly rocky and extends out into the
ocean for a considerable distance. Looks to me
as if it might be of volcanic origin, like we have
studied about in school. Over to the eastern end
of the island is that little bay, and there the jungle
is very dense. There are more rocks at the far
eastern end of the island, some quite tall.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t see anything at all in the way
of a settlement or a place where boats might
land?” questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“Not a thing! It looks to me as if this island
had never been visited.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon these islands are all visited once
in a while,” remarked Ira Small. “The natives
come in their long boats to see what they can pick
up. But we might have to wait a good many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
months before any one would come here to take
us off.”</p>

<p>“And it doesn’t look as if we could build a
boat ourselves—not with the material we have,”
answered Jack, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Then it looks as if we might be booked to stay
here quite a while,” remarked Randy. “Oh, dear,
I wonder what the folks at home will think!”
he went on soberly.</p>

<p>“They’ll think we have all been lost at sea,”
answered Fred.</p>

<p>“They will unless those aboard the <i>Hildegarde</i>
tell how we escaped in the motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Those rascals won’t open their mouths about
that,” answered Andy. “And even if they did,”
he went on, “they’d most likely think the motor
boat was lost in the hurricane.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think became of Ralph, Gif
and Spouter?” remarked Randy.</p>

<p>No one cared to reply to this. All wished to
hope for the best, yet down in their hearts they
were satisfied that their school chums had gone
to a watery grave. A sudden spell of melancholy
fastened itself upon the four Rover boys. The
mind of each traveled back to the loved ones at
home, and they could well visualize the agony of
mind which their parents and the girls must endure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“More than likely mother is half crazy, and
so are dad and Martha,” mused Jack to himself.
“Oh, if only we had a radio sending station, or
some carrier pigeons, or some means of communicating
with them!”</p>

<p>“I suppose the folks at home will start some
sort of a search for us,” said Fred, a little later.
“But it will be a good deal like looking for a pin
in a haystack.”</p>

<p>“We can only hope for the best, Fred,” said
Randy. “Gee, I wish we could do something!
I don’t want to stay on this forsaken island for
any great length of time!”</p>

<p>“None of us wants to stay here,” declared
Andy. “We haven’t any great stock of provisions,
and what are we going to do when those are
gone? Of course, we can catch fish, and maybe
get some oysters, and perhaps bring down a few
birds. But who wants to live on that sort of
stuff very long?”</p>

<p>“There may be something we can find to eat in
the jungle,” said Jack. “Bananas or cocoanuts
or mangoes, or some other semi-tropical stuff like
that. It isn’t likely there’s very much on a place
that’s so rocky.”</p>

<p>During the afternoon the boys explored the
island further, penetrating into the jungle for
quite a distance. Here, however, they found the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
thickets so dense that progress was almost impossible.</p>

<p>“We’d have to cut our way along to get to the
south side of the island,” declared Jack. “A fellow
could never get through unless he found some
sort of a trail.”</p>

<p>They did manage to reach the shore of the little
bay. Here the water was comparatively quiet,
and here they came upon some of the wreckage
that had torn itself loose from the improvised raft.</p>

<p>“We can make a little raft of that stuff and
sail around the bay on it,” said Jack. “But I
don’t see what good it will do.”</p>

<p>Too tired at last to do anything else, the boys
returned to their temporary camp and there proceeded
to fix an evening meal and prepare themselves
for a second night on the island. They
had secured a good-sized tarpaulin from the
wreckage, and, cutting some poles with a hatchet,
they soon had a tent erected. Then all the boys
set to work to cut down some small branches, with
which they fixed up beds for themselves and for
the old sailor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they had recovered all the firearms
left on the improvised raft, and none that had
been carried in their pockets had been lost, so
that now all were armed as before.</p>

<p>“But we must remember that our supply of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
ammunition is limited,” said Jack. “So don’t
shoot at anything unless you have to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what there is to shoot at,” answered
Randy, who was frying one of the fish brought
back from the pool.</p>

<p>“Well, something may turn up when you least
expect it,” answered the young major.</p>

<p>Their clothing was now dry, yet they presented
anything but an enviable appearance. Their linen
was much soiled and torn and their suits were also
torn and very much mussed up.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t do to go to a party, would we,
Jack?” remarked Fred, when they were preparing
to retire. “I wonder what Ruth Stevenson would
say if she saw you now.”</p>

<p>“Probably she’d be glad to see me and all the
rest of you, Fred,” was the prompt answer. “I
know I’d be mighty glad to see her and all of
the others. Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Would I! Would a duck swim or a monkey
eat peanuts? I’d give all I’m worth to be safe
and sound again at home or at Colby Hall. Gosh!
it seems as if we had been away for ages.”</p>

<p>Nothing that night disturbed the party, and all
were stirring early, each wondering what they
might do to get out of their predicament. To
stay on the lonely little island indefinitely was unthinkable.
Besides, they felt they must let their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
parents know of their whereabouts at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p>When Andy was dressing, Jack noticed that
Andy was surveying his injured ankle quite seriously.
The fun-loving Rover boy had lost much
of his light-heartedness.</p>

<p>“Does it still hurt, Andy?” he questioned
kindly.</p>

<p>“A little, Jack. But I don’t mind that so
much,” was the sober reply. “It’s when I try to
walk. It doesn’t seem to act like it used to.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s stiff. I can’t bend it, and it makes me
walk sort of flat-footed. Haven’t you noticed
it?”</p>

<p>“I thought you limped a little.”</p>

<p>“It’s worse than that. I don’t know what to
make of it. But I certainly don’t want to walk
with a limp all the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t think of such a thing!” exclaimed
Jack, in dismay. His cousin had always been so
acrobatic that to think of his being lame filled
the young major with dismay.</p>

<p>“If I could only see a doctor or get to a hospital,
maybe they could do something for it before
it got too bad,” went on Andy. “I guess I
need attention as much as Small does.”</p>

<p>As the boys did not wish to carry the pile of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
wood brought in from the breaking up of the improvised
raft, they shifted the camp a little closer
to where the wood lay, and there put up the tent
in more permanent fashion, digging a trench
around the back and both sides, so that in case of
rain the water would run off into the sand. They
also fixed some better bedding, and from some
stones built a small fireplace where they might
cook their meals to better advantage.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when
Randy, who had been walking up the beach in
the direction of the high rocks, came running back
in great excitement.</p>

<p>“Do you see it? Do you see it?” he called out
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do we see what?” asked several of the others
in chorus.</p>

<p>“A ship! There she is! And I believe she’s
coming to this island!”</p>

<p>All gazed in the direction to which Randy
pointed, and far out at sea they saw what seemed
to be a bark with all sails set.</p>

<p>“She’s either coming this way or else she’s
going to round the eastern end of the island,”
said Fred.</p>

<p>“Let’s do what we can to signal her!” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>The boys had already talked over the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
signals, and now they started up the fire and then
heaped upon it some damp brushwood, thereby
causing a dense smoke. Then two of them went
down the beach, waving a bit of sailcloth while the
other two went up the beach and did the same
thing.</p>

<p>Would their signals be seen? Anxiously the
boys waited to find out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<small>IN THE JUNGLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes went by slowly. The
wind had fallen somewhat, so the progress of
the vessel in the distance was slow.</p>

<p>“She’s coming this way, I’m sure of it!” declared
Randy.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too certain. You may be disappointed,”
answered Fred.</p>

<p>The youngest Rover boy had scarcely spoken
when the bark seemed to veer off to the eastward.</p>

<p>“She’s going away!”</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s only tacking in the wind.”</p>

<p>With strained eyes the boys watched the vessel
in the distance. Now she seemed to tack back,
much to their delight.</p>

<p>“She’s coming in!”</p>

<p>“They must be seeing our signals!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I wonder what sort of a vessel she
is?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she’s another rum-runner,” came
from Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Fred, don’t say that!” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t tell, Andy. We must be
right in the path of that kind of a ship. So many
of them run from the West Indies to the United
States.”</p>

<p>“Look, look!” cried Jack, in sudden dismay.
“She is turning away again.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. She is steering due east!”
added Randy, with something like a groan.</p>

<p>Another five minutes passed, and then all of
the boys, as well as the lanky sailor, came to the
conclusion that the bark was moving eastward.
Frantically the lads continued their signaling, and
saw to it that the clouds of smoke from their
fire continued. But if the signals were seen, no
one paid any attention to them, and presently
the bark, far to the eastward, was but a speck in
the distance on the bosom of the rolling ocean.</p>

<p>“She’s gone! They didn’t even notice us!”
exclaimed Fred, and his voice had something of
tears in it.</p>

<p>All were downcast, and it was some time before
they could get back to a more optimistic
frame of mind.</p>

<p>“They should have seen the smoke, even if
they couldn’t see us waving the sailcloth,” said
Randy, bitterly.</p>

<p>“Well, if they saw the smoke, they might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
thought it was from a fire built by some of the
natives,” answered Jack. “If I was sailing
among a great bunch of islands like the West
Indies, I wouldn’t want to stop to investigate
every pillar of smoke I saw.”</p>

<p>“If we only had a regular flag, then we could
hoist it up in one of the trees. If we placed it
upside down, that would be sure to attract attention
sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but we haven’t a flag, so we’ve got to
do without it,” said Andy, who was now rubbing
his hurt ankle in an endeavor to limber it up.</p>

<p>Another day passed, and by this time the boys
felt a little more at home on the island. A few
hours of fishing had sufficed to bring in a goodly
mess, and while some of these were eaten, the
others were placed in a pool where they might be
drawn upon whenever necessary. The boys had
also made a hunt for oysters, and while they had
found a few of the bivalves, they were not of a
particularly good variety, and no one cared for
them except the old tar.</p>

<p>“Some day I’m goin’ to make myself a good,
big stew of ’em,” said Ira Small. “I always did
like a stew made of oysters caught on the spot.”</p>

<p>Now that he could rest whenever he desired,
the lanky sailor recovered rapidly, so that in a
couple of days he was able to hobble around with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the aid of a cane which Jack cut for him. A
great friendship had sprung up between the young
major and the old tar.</p>

<p>“I ain’t forgot how you saved me from goin’
down to Davy Jones’ Locker,” the old sailor said
more than once. “An’ don’t you forgit what I
said about that pirates’ gold. If I lay hands on
it, you git your full share.”</p>

<p>After a quiet Sunday on the island Jack and
Randy made their way on Monday morning to
the little bay and there constructed a raft out of
the wreckage that had drifted into the opening.
Then, with their shoes slung around their necks
and their socks in their pockets, they set off for
the opposite shore of the bay, using two pieces of
boards for sculls.</p>

<p>“We may find nothing over there to interest
us,” said Jack. “Just the same, it won’t hurt to
go over. Perhaps we can find some sort of a
trail to the south side of the island.”</p>

<p>As the water was calm, it did not take the boys
long to reach the other side of the little bay.
Here they found a spot where landing was easy
and tied up the raft so that it might not float
away. Then, putting on their socks and shoes
again, they continued their explorations.</p>

<p>They soon found that progress in this direction
was almost as difficult as it had been in the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
of their first camp. The jungle was a mass
of tangled undergrowth and heavy vines, with
here and there some fair-sized palm trees. A
little further on they came to a series of rocks
which seemed to bar their further progress in
that direction.</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to be getting anywhere, Jack,”
remarked Randy, as he stopped to catch his breath
and wipe the perspiration from his brow. “Gee!
this doesn’t seem to be like December weather,
does it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you must remember we’re pretty well
south,” was the young major’s answer. “What
do you think we’d better do—go back?”</p>

<p>“Let’s move along the base of the rocks.
Maybe we’ll find some sort of an opening. I’d
like very much to get to the south shore of the
island, just to find out what is there.”</p>

<p>Once more they went on, advancing with care
for fear of slipping and perhaps spraining an
ankle. They had a hatchet with them, and often
had to cut the brushwood and the vines, to make a
passage for themselves.</p>

<p>“There is one thing we want to remember,”
said Jack, suddenly. “And that is that we’ve
got to get back. We don’t want to lose our
way.”</p>

<p>“I guess not!” exclaimed his cousin. “Why,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
if we lost our way in this jungle we might never
get out. We’d have to climb a tree or some of
those rocks just to locate ourselves.”</p>

<p>Presently, in the midst of the jungle, they came
to a small clearing. Here there was a rocky hollow,
and they found a bubbling spring of pure,
cool water.</p>

<p>“Say, this is worth while!” exclaimed Jack,
after each of them had taken a drink. “I wish
we had this spring near the camp,” he added as
they sat down to rest and eat their lunch.</p>

<p>“Look on the ground, will you!” exclaimed
Randy, suddenly. “Look at those footprints!
What do you make of them, Jack?”</p>

<p>Both gazed at the soft ground in the vicinity
of the spring, and there saw a number of footprints
evidently made by some wild animals.</p>

<p>“What animals do you suppose they can be?”
questioned Randy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. In fact, I don’t know what
sort of wild animals exist on these islands. They
are certainly not the marks of horses or cows or
sheep, or anything like that.”</p>

<p>“If there are any wild animals in this jungle,
we’d better be on our guard.”</p>

<p>“I should say so! I wish we had brought one
of the shotguns along.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>They had with them two of the pistols, but they
realized that these weapons might prove of small
use against any large beasts.</p>

<p>They looked around the vicinity of the spring,
but nothing in the way of an animal showed itself.
Not even a bird was in sight, and all
was as quiet as the grave.</p>

<p>What to do next, the two boys did not know.
If there were wild animals on the island, that
might change matters very much, so far as they
were concerned. They would have to keep on
guard continually, and might even have to take
some means of protecting themselves against attack.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose those beasts might be from
the wreck of the <i>Coryanda</i>?” said Randy suddenly.</p>

<p>“It’s possible. That wreck might have come
close enough for some of the animals to jump
overboard and swim ashore. Or, the vessel may
have struck the island and then gone to pieces and
drifted away before we had a chance to see what
happened.”</p>

<p>The boys discussed the situation and came to
the conclusion that the best thing they could do
would be to return to the camp and inform the
others of what they had discovered.</p>

<p>“If there are any wild animals loose here, every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
one of our crowd ought to know it,” said Jack.
“And the quicker we get the information to them
the better.”</p>

<p>He and Randy turned back and made their way
once more along the base of the rocks. It was
now about two o’clock in the afternoon, and they
hoped to return to camp well before dark, which,
in that portion of the globe, came on suddenly.</p>

<p>The two cousins had passed along less than
fifty yards when suddenly Jack held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Look, Randy! Look!” he whispered.</p>

<p>Randy did as directed, and there a short distance
ahead saw on a flat rock the form of a big
lion. The monarch of the jungle stood out
boldly. He was looking off into the brushwood
and acted as if he were watching something.</p>

<p>“It’s a lion!”</p>

<p>“Exactly! And as they don’t have lions down
here in the West Indies, it must be one of those
from the <i>Coryanda</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. What shall we do—fire at
him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would do much good—at least
not from such a distance. If we got closer
we might be able to wound him, even if we
didn’t kill him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t want to get closer, with nothing
but a pistol to shoot with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>“Neither do I. But what are we going to
do? He’s right in the way of our getting back
to the raft.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the boys saw the lion straighten up
and get ready as if to make a leap into the brushwood
below. Then they were startled as they
heard a rustling in the jungle, and the next moment
a full-sized goat leaped into the clearing
just ahead of them. The animal was evidently
full of fear, and knew not which way to turn.</p>

<p>“A goat!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s one of those that were on board
the steam yacht! Don’t you remember her?
The one with the black spots on her neck? The
one Andy said he’d like to try to milk?”</p>

<p>The goat saw the boys and, as if asking protection,
leaped toward them. Then from the
lion on the rock came a roar, and the next instant
the big beast hurled himself into the brushwood
in the direction of the goat.</p>

<p>“Gee, the goat is coming this way!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the lion is after her—or else he’s
after us!”</p>

<p>The two boys held ready their pistols, and as
they did so they retreated to the vicinity of the
rocks. They were backing up to these when
suddenly the goat leaped around, saw the lion,
and immediately made another leap and started<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
to scramble up the rocks within several yards of
where the boys were now crouching.</p>

<p>The lion came tearing forward, and then he
too bounded up on the lower rocks.</p>

<p>But hardly had he touched these when the goat
made a mighty leap and went up out of his reach.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’m glad the goat got away,” muttered
Randy.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when the lion, evidently
much disappointed, turned around on the
rocks and the next instant caught sight of the
two lads. Up went his mane and he let out a
savage roar, and then hurled himself in their
direction.</p>

<small>THE THIRTEEN ROCKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“He’s coming this way! Use your pistol,
quick!”</p>

<p>Crack! Crack! Both of the pistols spoke up,
and the lion was hit in the head and in the left
foreleg. Then the two Rover boys fired again,
this time at even closer range, one bullet piercing
the beast’s ear and the other plowing through the
skin of his back.</p>

<p>But nothing stopped the rush of the ferocious
lion, and it was only by leaping to the rear of
the nearest rock that Jack and Randy escaped the
onslaught.</p>

<p>In the next few minutes so many things happened
that it is almost impossible to describe them.
The lion, with another roar and snarling from
pain, came around the rocks just as the boys
leaped up. Then, standing several feet above the
beast, they fired once more. The lion retreated,
got wedged in between a tree and a rock, and
turned savagely, probably thinking in his excitement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
that he had in some way been attacked from
the rear.</p>

<p>“There’s a shelf just above us!” exclaimed
Jack, glancing around for some means of escape.
“Let’s get up there!”</p>

<p>Roar after roar came from the lion, the sound
so terrifying it was enough to make anybody
tremble. The goat was leaping from rock to
rock, and now disappeared from sight. The
shelf the young major mentioned was a rocky
one about three feet above their heads. Over it
grew a few vines, and Randy clutched these only
to have them come away in his hands.</p>

<p>“Here, let me boost you up, Randy!” exclaimed
Jack. “Quick! That lion may take it into his
head to leap at us!”</p>

<p>“But what of you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get up somehow! Hurry! We have no
time to waste!”</p>

<p>In a few seconds Randy was boosted to the
shelf. Looking around, he saw a place where
he could dig in with his toes, and he promptly
lay flat, extending his hands downward as he did
so.</p>

<p>“Come on! I’ll help pull you up!” he gasped.
“Hurry up! The lion is getting ready to jump.”</p>

<p>Thus assisted, the young major managed to
scale the wall and reach the rocky shelf. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
scarcely done so when the lion, crouching low,
made a wild leap upward.</p>

<p>The distance the beast covered was fully fifteen
feet, and both the Rover boys felt that he
might have gained the rocky shelf had it not been
for Randy’s quick action. Beside him lay a
jagged stone half as big as his head. This he
scooped up and launched at the beast when the
lion was less than a yard away. The stone did
little damage to the lion physically, but the attack
was so unexpected that the forward movement
of the king of the jungle was stopped, and
he dropped down on the rocks from which he
had come.</p>

<p>“Fire at him, Jack!” called out Randy.
“Give him every bullet you’ve got!” And then
both boys emptied their pistols into the beast
as he stood there, evidently trying to make up
his mind what next to do.</p>

<p>Some of the shots went wild, but two hit the
lion squarely in the side, and now with roars of
pain and fear the beast suddenly retreated and the
next instant disappeared in the undergrowth on
the edge of the jungle.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll come back!”</p>

<p>“Let’s reload just as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>The last suggestion was a good one, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
carried it out immediately. In the meanwhile,
they kept their eyes on the jungle, but the lion
did not show himself.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s mortally wounded,” suggested
Randy.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” answered his cousin. “But we
can’t take any chances on such a big beast as
that. Gee! when he leaped for this shelf, I
was scared. I thought he was about ready to eat
us up.”</p>

<p>“He’d have killed us both, Jack, if he could
have gotten at us,” answered Randy, with a shudder.</p>

<p>The boys realized that they had been in great
danger, and if they were exceedingly nervous,
who could blame them? With reloaded pistols,
they waited where they stood, straining their
eyes and ears for any other movement the lion
might make.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is,” said Jack, “if that
lion and that goat came ashore from the
<i>Coryanda</i>, for all we know, all the other beasts,
and maybe the snakes, came ashore too.”</p>

<p>“They could only do that if the steam yacht
was completely wrecked so that the cages were
broken open.”</p>

<p>“Well, those cages didn’t look very secure to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
me. Don’t forget how that snake and that tiger
got loose.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get back to camp somehow and
warn the others. But I must confess I don’t feel
much like going through that jungle to where
we left the little raft.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I. I’d rather try to climb over the
rocks and get to the bay, somehow or other, that
way.”</p>

<p>The boys made an investigation and presently
found a place at the end of the narrow shelf
where two or three rough steps led upward.
Neither of them wished to trust himself in the
jungle, and so they kept on for over half an hour,
climbing one rocky height after another in their
endeavor to reach the bay without taking to the
heavy growth to the westward.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I see the ocean!” cried Randy,
presently. “I think if we keep on in this direction
we’ll soon get to a point where we can get
down to the bay. But, of course, we’ll be quite a
distance from where we left that raft.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Maybe we can swim back to
the raft,” answered Jack. He felt that anything
would be better than facing such wild beasts as
might now be roaming the otherwise deserted
island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>It was hard work climbing over the rocks,
which in many places were sharp and irregular.</p>

<p>“Look out that you don’t go down into some
deep hole,” warned Jack. “You might get
wedged so tight you’d never get out.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that goat got along easily enough.
A goat loves to leap the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’re not goats. Come on! We
want to get back before night.”</p>

<p>The boys moved forward, but the going was
now more perilous than ever, and presently, having
leaped to a spot that looked fairly easy to
negotiate, they found further progress all but
impossible.</p>

<p>“Looks like we were stuck, Randy,” said the
young major, scratching his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t say that, Jack! We don’t want to
go back after coming all this distance!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if we can’t go ahead we’ll have to go
back.”</p>

<p>For ten minutes the two youths searched
around, and then managed to find a split between
two of the rocks and beyond this a rocky slope
leading still farther upward.</p>

<p>“We might as well try this,” said Randy.
“If it doesn’t lead to anywhere we can go back.”</p>

<p>The rocky slope ended in something of a
plateau. The boys were now at one of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
points on the island and could see in almost
all directions, the heavy jungle cutting off only
a small part of the coast line in the southwest.
To the north and the east, as well as the southeast,
rolled the mighty Atlantic, flashing in the
rays of the declining sun. To the eastward on
the island were innumerable rocks, some of them
fantastic in shape and forming a sort of bowl,
the bottom of which was now shrouded in shadows.</p>

<p>“My gracious! this whole end of the island is
nothing but rocks,” declared Randy.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Jack, pointing to the coast
southward. “Unless I’m greatly mistaken there
is the wreck of the <i>Coryanda</i>!”</p>

<p>“It’s the old steam yacht just as sure as you’re
born!” answered his cousin.</p>

<p>“No wonder I didn’t see the wreck from the
top of that palm tree,” went on the young major.
“See how she’s wedged in between the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it looks to me as if her backbone was
broken, Jack. Anyway, she’s split bow and
stern. No wonder the animals got loose.
Smashing up on the rocks that way must have
loosened everything.”</p>

<p>“Maybe most of the animals were killed by
the shocks.”</p>

<p>“I hope they were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>The two boys walked to a nearby rock in an
endeavor to get a better view of the wreck, which
was all of a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>“We’d have a hard job getting down to her,
I’m thinking,” remarked Jack. “I don’t believe
we’d ever be able to get over those rocks. We’d
have either to sail around to the eastward, or
otherwise make our way to the south shore and
get to her from that point.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad we located her, Jack; aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“To be sure I am, Randy. If we have to stay
on this island any great length of time we’ll
probably need everything we can get from the
yacht. We didn’t have any great variety on the
raft, remember, and we need some clothing as
well as food.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget that we want a flag to
hoist upside down as a signal of distress.”</p>

<p>Having inspected the wreck as well as they
could from such a distance, the boys began speculating
on how they might get down from the
rocks to the eastern shore of the little bay. They
had to go forward with caution, because at every
step the way seemed to become more perilous.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe any human being was ever
on these rocks before,” was Randy’s comment.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” answered Jack.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
“What would bring a person up to such an out-of-the-way
place, anyhow? There isn’t much to
this island, and I don’t wonder the natives give
it the go-by.”</p>

<p>The boys went a few yards farther, and then
both leaped to a rock that seemed to be secure,
but which was not. Under their combined
weight it tilted unexpectedly, and they suddenly
found themselves sliding they knew not to where.</p>

<p>“Grab hold!” yelled Jack, and did what he
could to stop his progress, and Randy did likewise.</p>

<p>Down they went over one slippery rock after
another, bringing up at last in a sort of pocket on
the side of a cliff. Here they stood panting for
breath and rubbing their shins and their elbows,
which had been sadly scraped in the descent.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! I thought we were going
down to kingdom come,” gasped Randy.</p>

<p>“Now we are in a pickle!” returned the young
major. “How ever are we going to get out of
this place?”</p>

<p>Jack began to look around, wondering what
their next move might be. An instant later he let
out an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>“What is it, Jack?” queried his cousin, as he
saw the young major pointing his finger and
counting slowly to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“Look there, Randy! Am I right, or am I only
dreaming? Do you see these sharp-pointed rocks
all around us? Well, just count them, will you?”</p>

<p>Catching what was in Jack’s mind, Randy began
to count the huge circle of sharp-pointed
rocks.</p>

<p>“Why, there are thirteen of them!” he burst
out. “Oh, Jack! do you think——”</p>

<p>“That this is the place Ira Small has been talking
about? Well, it certainly looks like it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<small>THIEVES IN CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The two boys gazed in awe at the circle of
thirteen sharp-pointed rocks which arose majestically
in a circle that was all of an eighth of a
mile in diameter. There were other rocks on
every side, but these stood out distinctly so that
there was no mistaking them.</p>

<p>“If these are the thirteen rocks Small has been
talking about, then that pirates’ treasure ought to
be located in the center of this circle,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“And that would be somewhere down there,”
added Randy, pointing with his finger to the rocks
far below them. “Jack, do you really think
there is a treasure here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Randy. It may be only a fairy
tale. Why should any pirates come to such a
forsaken place as this to bury their treasure?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking. It would be
much easier for them to bury their gold close to
where their ship landed. They would have an
awful job getting to such a spot as this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps there’s some secret way of getting
from the shore to this place—some trail over and
between the rocks of which we know nothing.
Anyway, the thirteen rocks are here.”</p>

<p>“I wish we had seen those photographs the old
sailor talked about. Then we’d know in a minute
whether this was really the place or not.”</p>

<p>Had the rocks been less dangerous to climb,
both of the boys would have tried to descend to
the center of the rocky bowl in a quest of the
pirates’ treasure. But they realized that it would
be extremely dangerous to attempt to approach
that place from where they stood, and so, rather
regretfully, they turned their backs on the thirteen
high-pointed rocks and continued their search
for some means of reaching the little bay where
they had left their raft.</p>

<p>“Gee, this is certainly some island to be on,”
was Randy’s comment, as they moved forward
slowly and cautiously, testing every foothold to
make certain that it was secure. “Wild animals
and a pirates’ treasure!”</p>

<p>“It would sound exciting to read about,” commented
the young major. “Just the same, I’d
like to be out of this mess, Randy.”</p>

<p>“So would I. And just think of the folks at
home! How they must be worried about us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but there is something even worse than
that. Think of Ralph, Gif and Spouter.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking about them every day, Jack.
Life at Colby Hall won’t be the same with Gif
and Spouter gone. And Ralph certainly was a
fine fellow.”</p>

<p>It was growing dark when the two Rover
boys at last reached a point where getting down
to the eastern shore of the bay was comparatively
easy. By this time they were all but exhausted
from their efforts, and both resolved to break
through a short bit of the jungle in an endeavor
to reach the raft.</p>

<p>“Keep your pistol ready for use, Randy,”
warned the young major, and then he moved forward
with his firearm in one hand and the hatchet
in the other.</p>

<p>Both boys were on edge, thinking that some
wild animal might pounce out upon them at any
instant. But nothing happened to disturb them,
and a little later they reached the raft and, much
relieved, sculled their way over to the other side
of the bay, this time landing as close to the ocean
and its sandy shore as possible.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello!” came from out of the fast-gathering
darkness, and a moment later in reply
to their answering calls Fred appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<p>“I supposed you’d be getting anxious about us,”
said Jack. “We certainly have had plenty of
things happen to-day. We’ll tell you all about it
when we get back to camp.”</p>

<p>Seated comfortably in camp and partaking of a
substantial meal gotten ready by the other boys,
Jack and Randy told first about the encounter with
the lion.</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope you killed him!” cried Fred. “I
don’t want to meet such a beast as that around
here.”</p>

<p>“The lion must have come from the yacht,”
put in Ira Small. “An’ if that’s so, then the
ship must have come ashore on the island.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what she did,” answered Randy.
“We saw the wreck lying between the rocks away
off to the southeast.”</p>

<p>“Did you visit the ship?” questioned Andy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No. We were too far away, and climbing
over those rough rocks is no easy task.”</p>

<p>“And now we have something of more importance
to tell,” said Jack. “That is, we hope it may
prove of more importance. Small, I’d like to
see those photographs of those thirteen rocks
you’ve been talking about.”</p>

<p>“Jumping toadstools, Jack! you don’t mean
to say that you’ve spotted those thirteen rocks?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
ejaculated Andy, and for a moment he stood
straight up, forgetting all about his twisted ankle.</p>

<p>“We certainly did see thirteen rocks; great
big ones, too, and all in a circle!” cried Randy,
proudly. “Of course; they may not be the thirteen
rocks Small has been talking about, but
there were thirteen of them, and all in a circle,
just as plain as the nose on your face!”</p>

<p>“Hurray! I knowed them rocks was on an
island somewhere around here!” burst out the
lanky sailor. “I been figgerin’ it out in my
mind ever since we come ashore. Wait! Somebody
give me a sharp pocketknife an’ I’ll cut them
photygraphs loose so you kin see ’em.”</p>

<p>The two photographs were soon brought forth
from the shirt pocket into which they had been
sewn; and by the aid of the searchlight Jack and
Randy examined them carefully.</p>

<p>“The same place!” exclaimed Randy. “Don’t
you think so, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do!” was the ready reply. “Just
look at that rock there and the one over here!
Don’t you remember how this one had two points
and that one had three?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and this one here was just a bit flatter
than any of the others. Oh, it’s the same place!
I’m sure of it!”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s the same place, do you suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
pirates’ gold is there?” questioned Andy, quickly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” answered the young
major. “The whole center of the circle seems to
be formed like a huge bowl and is very rocky.
We had no means of getting down to the middle
of it. As it was, we slipped two or three times
and nearly broke our necks.”</p>

<p>“The gold is there, I know it is!” came solemnly
from Ira Small. “We’ll have to go on a hunt
for it first chance we git.”</p>

<p>“Of course these pictures weren’t taken from
anywhere near where we stood,” said Jack, after
looking at the photographs a second time. “It
looks to me as if they’d been taken from the north.
And if that’s so, then there must be some way of
getting down into the rocky bowl from that direction.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idee how they got to the place,” said
the lanky sailor. “There must be some kind of a
path leadin’ from the shore. Mebby the pirates
cast anchor outside of the keys an’ come ashore in
small boats.”</p>

<p>Eagerly the four Rover boys and the old tar
talked the matter over. For the time being they
forgot completely about the wreck of the <i>Coryanda</i>
and the wild beasts and snakes which might
have come ashore. Presently, however, Jack reminded
them of the peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve got to keep all our weapons handy and
somebody will have to remain on guard after this,”
he said. “We don’t want a couple of lions or
tigers surprising us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we don’t want any big snakes crawling
in to sleep with us,” put in Fred, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Let’s keep the fire bright,” suggested Andy.
“Wild beasts don’t like a blaze.”</p>

<p>“If we could only get to the wreck of the steam
yacht, perhaps we’d be able to find some rifles,”
said Jack. “Then I’d feel almost like going after
those wild beasts. But I don’t care to do it with a
shotgun or a pistol.”</p>

<p>They talked the matter over still further, and
in the end made up a regular schedule so that each
of the boys, as well as the old sailor, would take
his turn at remaining on guard. Of course, the
old tar could not do much in the way of moving
around, but his eyes and his ears were as alert
as any one’s, and that was all that was necessary.</p>

<p>The night, however, passed without incident,
and morning found Jack and Randy much rested;
and with daylight the alarm over the wild beasts
subsided somewhat.</p>

<p>“I wish we had some sort of a boat,” said Jack,
while eating breakfast. “Then we could skirt the
island and visit the <i>Coryanda</i>, and also look for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
some sort of path leading to that circle of rocks.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we build a sort of scow out of the
wreckage?” questioned Fred. “We’ve got plenty
of boards and ropes, and I think we could get
quite a lot of nails out of the stuff if we set to
work to do it.”</p>

<p>As nothing else suggested itself, the boys surveyed
all the wreckage they had brought ashore
and finally concluded they might utilize a portion
of it in building a sort of sharp-pointed scow.
Then they set to work, Ira Small hobbling down
the sandy shore to watch them.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to build the scow, and it
was not until noon of the next day that the craft
was ready for use. They had nailed it as tight as
possible, but this was not saying much, and they
relied mostly on the solid flooring with which the
scow was furnished to keep them afloat.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have to make some sort of sweeps
for it and then we’ll be ready to set sail,” declared
Fred.</p>

<p>All had become so interested in making the
scow seaworthy, that, for the time being, the
camp had been forgotten.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s about time somebody got grub
ready,” murmured Andy, presently. “Scow or
no scow, I want my dinner.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go on back and start things,” returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
Jack. “Perhaps you’d better go with him,
Fred. Randy and I can finish here. We’ll be
along in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Fred and Andy walked back in the direction of
the camp with Ira Small hobbling after them.
They had covered not more than half the distance
when Andy gave a sudden cry.</p>

<p>“Look what’s going on in camp!” he exclaimed.
“What in the world are those things, anyway?”</p>

<p>Fully two dozen small forms were moving rapidly
in and around the camp. What was being
done neither of the boys could surmise until
suddenly Fred let out a yell of dismay.</p>

<p>“They’re monkeys! What do you know about
that!”</p>

<p>“They must be the monkeys from the wrecked
yacht,” answered his cousin. “And look! Do
you see what they’re doing? They’re carrying
off our things!”</p>

<small>AT THE WALL OF ROCKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Had it not been such a serious situation, the
two Rover boys would have been inclined to laugh
at what was happening. But they realized that
the canned food and other things in the camp
meant a great deal to them, and they did not intend
that the monkeys should make away with the
stuff.</p>

<p>“Get out of there! Scoot! Scat!” yelled
Fred, running forward.</p>

<p>He was followed by his cousin, and in a moment
more both boys found themselves in the
midst of the simians. The monkeys chattered
and squeaked in alarm, but none of them seemed
to be inclined to retreat. Many of them had found
something to eat, and the others were snooping
around, doing their best to tear open packages
or break open some of the canned goods.</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” yelled Fred. He had
scarcely spoken when one of the monkeys dropped
a can of beans on his toes and leaped upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
youth’s left shoulder. “Hi! Get off of there!”</p>

<p>But instead of getting away, the <a href="#i_fp274">monkey caught
hold of Fred’s ear and</a> held tight, shrieking and
chattering loudly as he did so.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile <a href="#i_fp274">two other monkeys leaped
upon Andy</a>, one on his shoulder and the other
on his back, holding tight to the alarmed boy’s
collar. The other simians ran back and forth,
chattering most infernally. One had picked up
a pan brought in from the wreckage, and
this he banged upon any object that came to
hand.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>“For gracious’ sake! what’s that racket in
camp?” exclaimed Jack, looking up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Come here! Some monkeys have
attacked the two boys!” yelled Ira Small at the
top of his lungs. And then, somewhat scared at
the unexpected turn of affairs, the lanky sailor
blazed away with a shotgun he was carrying.</p>

<p>The aim of the old tar was poor, and the shots
scattered into the jungle back of the camp. But
the noise had its effect, and in a twinkling all but
two of the monkeys began to take their departure.
But they did not go empty handed. With loose
food, canned stuff and other things in their paws,
they scrambled into the jungle, and, amid a wild
chattering, disappeared.</p>

<p>“Monkeys, of all things!” burst out Randy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
rushing forward beside the young major. “Who
ever thought they would come to attack us!”</p>

<p>“They’re probably hungry, just the same as
that lion was,” answered Jack. “There they go!”</p>

<p>The two monkeys that remained were the ones
that had clung fast to Fred’s ear and one of those
which had fastened itself to Andy’s collar. These
continued to chatter and squeak, but held fast as
if seeking companionship and protection.</p>

<p>“Gee, do you know what I think?” declared
Andy, suddenly. “This little beggar is tame.
He isn’t half as wild as those others were.”</p>

<p>By this time the other monkey had let loose of
Fred’s ear, and now sat perched on the lad’s
hand, looking up into Fred’s face so comically
that the youth was compelled to grin.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to be friendly, all right,” said
the boy. “Just the same, you had me pretty well
scared.” And then he stroked the monkey, and
the frisky little animal seemed well content to
nestle in the crook of his arm.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager that these two monkeys were pets
of the people on board the steam yacht,” declared
Jack, when the momentary excitement had
come to an end and the party had made sure that
all the other monkeys had disappeared. “If it
wasn’t so, these fellows wouldn’t stay here a
minute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” answered Fred. “Just
the same, what are we going to do with the two
little beggars? We don’t want to feed them,
and I’m certain that I don’t want to kill them.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to feed them and then chase them
back into the woods,” suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“You’ll have fine work chasin’ ’em away after
you’ve fed ’em,” declared Ira Small, coming as
close to grinning as the boys had ever seen.
“Feed a monkey once, an’ you’ll have him around
you forever. The only way to git rid of ’em is to
douse ’em with cold water.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if they want to stay, let them,” answered
Jack. “They’ll help us pass the time when we
haven’t anything else to do.” The cuteness of
the two little simians appealed to him, just as it
did to all the other boys.</p>

<p>A little later, after the monkeys had been fed
to their hearts’ content, the Rover boys tied them
to nearby trees so that they might not get into
further mischief.</p>

<p>It was not until the following morning that all
started out in the clumsy scow, if such it might
be called, to make the trip around the eastern end
of the island to where the wreck of the <i>Coryanda</i>
lay. On the way they thought they might land
once or twice on the sandy beach below the rocks
in an endeavor to find some passageway leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
to the spot where they thought the pirates’ gold
might be hidden.</p>

<p>At first Jack and Randy had thought to take
the trip, in company with Ira Small; but Fred
and Andy had protested so vigorously that it
was finally decided that all should go, even though
the scow might be rather crowded.</p>

<p>The clumsy craft had been provided with four
extra long sculls, or sweeps, and everybody, even
to Andy, went barefooted, knowing that they
might be standing in several inches of water
most of the time. They carried their shoes in
a water-tight canister, so that they might have
these foot coverings whenever they landed. They
also carried with them a supply of food, not knowing
how long they would be away.</p>

<p>It was an ideal day for the trip. There was
hardly any wind, and consequently the surf at the
keys and along the beach had greatly subsided.
They got afloat without much trouble, and then
the old sailor took command, telling them how
they might progress to the best advantage.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no need to go out any further than jest
to keep from bein’ throwed up on them rocks,”
he said, after they had passed the entrance to the
little bay. “An’ every one keep his eyes peeled
for anything that looks like an openin’.”</p>

<p>“Were there any marks leading to the treasure—I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
mean anything in the way of a signboard?”
questioned Randy of the lanky sailor.</p>

<p>“There was supposed to be a triangle,” answered
Ira Small. “A triangle of three arrows.
Them sailors said the triangle led to the circle.”</p>

<p>“Then, having found the circle, we’ll have to
keep our eyes open for the triangle,” murmured
the young major.</p>

<p>Slowly and not without some danger, they
finally rounded the eastern point of the island.
Although they had watched closely, no one had
discovered any opening that might lead to the
bowl of the thirteen rocks. Here and there they
had discovered small bunches of brushwood and
vines growing among the rocks, and had seen
higher up innumerable nests of sea birds, but that
was all.</p>

<p>“But the opening must be there—that is if the
yarn about the treasure is true,” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make a more careful search
when we’re coming back,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the opening is behind some of those
vines or bushes,” put in Andy.</p>

<p>Having rounded the eastern end of the island,
it did not take them long to reach the vicinity of
the spot where the <i>Coryanda</i> had been cast up
among the rocks. Here were innumerable little
keys, and Ira Small rightfully guessed that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
was only the force of the hurricane that had
driven the water-logged steam yacht in so far
and with such dire results.</p>

<p>“She’s busted clean an’ clear,” was the lanky
sailor’s comment. “Busted, lengthwise an’ sidewise.
They won’t never be able to do a thing
with her. She’s gone forever.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go slow about going aboard,”
said Jack. “No more wild beasts for me!”</p>

<p>“Or snakes, either,” added Fred.</p>

<p>They had brought along the shotguns and pistols,
and had seen to it that every weapon was
fully loaded. Now, as they came up beside the
rocks on which the <i>Coryanda</i> rested, Jack told
Fred and Andy to remain at the sweeps while he
and Randy and the old sailor held their weapons
ready for use should the occasion require.</p>

<p>But all seemed calm and peaceful in the vicinity
of the wreck, and, gaining courage, the whole
party presently landed, made fast, and mounted
to the deck of the old steam yacht at a point
close to the cabin.</p>

<p>A glance around showed them that everything
was in the wildest disorder. Evidently the water-logged
yacht, driven by the hurricane, had
pounded on the rocks time and again before some
extra large wave had cast her up and broken her
into practically four pieces, two forward and two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
aft. Hatchways and the runway for the animals
were wide open, and in one spot they could look
down an opening to the very keel of the vessel.</p>

<p>“Be careful how you move around,” warned
Randy. “Otherwise, somebody may slip through
one of those openings and break his neck.”</p>

<p>On account of the condition of the steam yacht,
and because there might still be some of the wild
beasts or snakes present, they moved around the
wreck with great caution. Thus an hour or more
passed. They found a sheep and a little deer,
both wedged in the wreckage and dead.</p>

<p>“The animals and the snakes seem to be gone,”
declared Jack, at last. “And all of the monkeys
have gone, too, and also the parrots. About all
that are left are a few of the small birds, and I
guess we might as well give them their liberty.”
And this was done.</p>

<p>When the noon hour was reached all were tired
and hungry and glad enough to sit down on the
deck and eat a portion of the food they had
brought along. As they did this they talked
over the situation.</p>

<p>“There are plenty of stores here, and most of
the stuff seems to be in good condition,” remarked
Jack. “So, no matter what else happens, we’re not
liable to starve to death.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we could stay on board if we wanted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
to?” suggested Fred. “It might be safer to sleep
in the cabin here, even in its partly wrecked condition,
than to bunk out on the beach with those
wild animals at large.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to stay all the time,” put in
Randy. “We can’t stretch our legs here. Besides,
it might be dangerous if another hurricane
struck us. I saw some rifles on board, and if
we arm ourselves with those, I’d rather be back in
the vicinity of the old camp.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever the crowd want to do——”
began Jack, and then came to a sudden stop. A
distant humming had reached his ears, and this
humming steadily increased in volume.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose that is?” questioned
Andy, looking at Jack curiously. He, too, had
noticed the humming.</p>

<p>“Sounds like an aeroplane motor,” was the
quick reply. “Hear how loud it’s getting!”</p>

<p>“There it is!” shouted Randy, pointing skyward.
“It’s an aeroplane as sure as you’re born!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s heading this way!” cried Fred.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<small>A SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For several seconds all those on the deck of
the wrecked steam yacht watched the on-coming
flying machine with intense interest. Then
Randy uttered a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>“The flag! Let’s put it out upside down for
a distress signal!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and let’s make some smoke! We can
do it with some wet papers,” put in Fred.</p>

<p>While Fred and Andy got ready the smoke
signal, Randy and the young major rushed to
where they had found the flags belonging to the
wrecked vessel. As quickly as possible they selected
the biggest Old Glory on board and brought
it out on the deck.</p>

<p>“How kin you raise it?” questioned Ira Small.
“There ain’t no masts.”</p>

<p>“We’ll tie it to a pole and hold it up from the
top of the cabin,” answered Jack, hurriedly.</p>

<p>In all haste the flag was fastened to a pole
the boys had noticed some time before and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
then raised to the top of the cabin, where Randy
and Jack waved it frantically at the on-coming
’plane. A few minutes later the flying machine
was almost directly overhead. It was of fair
size and contained two occupants.</p>

<p>“It’s a hydroplane!” exclaimed Fred. “See
the pontoons under it?”</p>

<p>“I hope she lands,” murmured Andy.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they can land on the ocean
very well,” said Jack. “But they might land in
that bay on the north shore.”</p>

<p>Eagerly the whole party watched the movements
of the hydroplane. It seemed to be passing
them by when it slowly turned in a wide
circle to the eastward. Then it came along over
the wreck once more.</p>

<p>“They’re dropping something!” cried Jack.
“Here it comes!”</p>

<p>A white object about as big as a man’s head
came dropping down from the hydroplane. It
was evidently of light weight, for its descent was
not rapid and the wind carried it from over the
stern of the wreck to a point just beyond the
bow. Then the hydroplane sailed on.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it’s a message of some sort!” burst
out Randy, and he and Fred scrambled over the
side of the yacht and on to the rocks where the
object lay. They found it was made of paper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
tied lightly with a string, and to it was attached
a bit of cardboard on which was written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Wreck and distress signals seen. Cannot land.
Will notify U. S. Government without delay.
Can you hold out forty-eight hours? If so, turn
flag.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="padr2 smcap">Jackson.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Borderwell.</span>”<br /></p>
</div>

<p>“Hurrah for Jackson and Borderwell, whoever
they may be!” cried Jack, happily. “Come on!
Let’s turn the flag right side up!” and this was
quickly done.</p>

<p>Again the hydroplane made a turn, this time
wider than before. Then the flying machine
passed over the wreck at a lower level, and they
could see the two aviators peering anxiously down
at them. They waved the flag in delight and
Andy and Randy threw kisses to show that everything
was all right. Then they saw each of the
aviators wave their arms in return. A few seconds
later the hydroplane passed southward once
more.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she’s bound for Porto Rico!” cried
Jack, and in this surmise he was correct.</p>

<p>“If only we could have sent word to the folks
that we’re safe!” sighed Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>But even with this drawback, the boys felt
tremendously relieved, and had it not been for his
twisted ankle Andy would have danced a jig of
joy. Their situation would soon be known to the
outside world, and they were certain that relief
would not be slow in coming.</p>

<p>“Forty-eight hours won’t be so long to wait,”
said Randy. “Why, that’s only two days!”</p>

<p>“That will give us time to hunt for the pirates’
gold!” exclaimed the lanky sailor. “I wish my
leg was better. I’d climb over them stones somehow
or other and git to the middle of the circle
of the thirteen rocks.”</p>

<p>“Now that we know that help is coming, we
can spend all our time in trying to locate the
gold,” said Randy. “Why not take another trip
along the base of the rocks in the scow? We can
post a notice here telling where we’ve gone, so
that if any one arrives they’ll wait for us.”</p>

<p>They finished their interrupted meal and then
decided to make another tour in the scow without
delay. It was very calm, the wind having
gone down completely, so they felt they could
approach quite close to the cliffs without much
danger of another wreck.</p>

<p>For fully two hours the party of five moved
slowly along the rocky shore, inspecting every foot
of the way for some hidden trail by which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
might get to the bowl encircled by the thirteen
rocks.</p>

<p>“There might be an opening behind that bunch
of vines,” remarked Andy, presently. “It looks
as if there were some sort of opening there.”</p>

<p>They had brought with them several long-handled
boathooks, and by means of these they managed
to make a landing on the rocks, and Randy
and Fred climbed to the point where the vines
mentioned were growing. Here they found an
opening several yards in depth, inhabited by
numerous sea birds that flocked forth in much
astonishment.</p>

<p>“There is an opening,” shouted Randy, after
throwing the rays of the searchlight around,
“but it doesn’t lead to anything. It’s just a blind
pocket.”</p>

<p>After this the search was continued for another
hour, and the boys visited two other places
along the rocky barrier. One was thickly matted
with vines, and here they found the foothold
very uncertain, and Jack and Fred, who were doing
the climbing, came close to tumbling down
into the ocean.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look as if there was any sort of an
opening around here,” came dolefully from
Andy. He was sorry that he could not do some
of the climbing himself, but he knew that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
had to take care of his hurt ankle or that member
might become so bad that he could not use it
at all.</p>

<p>“We won’t give up yit!” cried Ira Small.
“I’m goin’ to git down in that circle of rocks if
I’ve got to stay behind on the island all alone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we wouldn’t dream of going off without
you, Small,” answered Randy, quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t goin’ to leave till I’ve made a
search,” answered the old tar, stubbornly. “That
thing’s been in my mind fur five years, an’ I
ain’t goin’ to give up now when I know where
them rocks are located.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll have to get an airship in which
to get down into the bowl,” said Andy, making
a wry face.</p>

<p>Again they went on, and now they were less
than an eighth of a mile from where the rocky
wall came to an end and the jungle took its place,
leading, a short distance farther along, to the entrance
to the little bay which Jack and Randy
had navigated on the raft.</p>

<p>“What a lot of birds,” remarked Jack, as they
went along close to the rocky cliff. “I never saw
so many in my life.”</p>

<p>“It would be easy to get enough for a bird pot-pie—if
a fellow wanted it,” added Andy, with a
grin. Then, however, the fun-loving Rover shut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
his mouth tightly and began to rub his hurt
ankle.</p>

<p>“Hurt very much, Andy?” asked Fred, kindly.</p>

<p>“It starts up every once in a while,” was the
answer. “I don’t notice it, and then of a sudden
it seems to go right back on me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to see a doctor—just as soon as
we can get to where there is one,” put in his
brother.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. But I’ll wait till we get home
first.”</p>

<p>As they moved along both the boys and the
lanky sailor kept their eyes on all the flat rocks
which were passed. Presently Fred saw what he
took to be the picture of an arrow carved on one
of the rocks, and he pointed this out to the others.
Close to the arrow grew some trailing vines from
a small opening just above.</p>

<p>“Gee, that does look like an arrow!” cried
Andy, with interest.</p>

<p>“Yes. But there were to be three arrows
forming a triangle,” remarked his twin.</p>

<p>Curious to know if the mark was really meant
for an arrow, they sculled the scow in closer
to the rocks and then pulled the vines aside with
one of the long boathooks.</p>

<p>“There are the three arrows, just as plain as
day!” burst out Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>He was right. There, on the face of a large
upright rock, the representation of three arrows
had been cut. Each arrow was about two feet
in length, the bottom one horizontal and the others
running down to a base probably four feet long.</p>

<p>“It’s a triangle, all right enough! A triangle
with the three angles left open!” ejaculated
Randy.</p>

<p>“Yes, but where is the opening?” came quickly
from Ira Small. He was as much excited as any
of the boys.</p>

<p>“It must be up behind those vines!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>It was no easy task to get up the side of the
smooth rock, and had it not been for the substantial
boathooks they carried and the support
of some of the vines, they would have been unable
to make it. However, Jack and Randy managed
finally to reach the opening and speedily
began an investigation. But this amounted to
nothing. The opening was very irregular, and
all the passages leading from it went up instead
of down.</p>

<p>“How are you making out?” shouted Andy,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing up here, as far as I can see,”
announced Jack.</p>

<p>“Maybe there’s some sort of a secret trapdoor,”
suggested Fred, hopefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>For over a quarter of an hour Randy and Jack
continued their investigations of the little opening
just above the triangle of arrows. Then they
came to the edge of the hole and looked down
blankly at those on the scow.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said Randy, disconsolately. “If
there’s any passageway here, we can’t find it.”</p>

<p>While the search was in progress, those on the
scow had had no easy time of it to keep the craft
from becoming damaged on the rocks. Now, as
an extra large wave rolled in from the ocean,
Fred used one of the boathooks as a fender. But
the hook on the end of the pole slipped down,
and the next instant boy and pole disappeared
from view into the ocean at the base of the rocky
cliff!</p>

<small>IN THE CIRCLE OF THIRTEEN ROCKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Fred’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Push the scow back! Otherwise he’ll be
smashed!”</p>

<p>Such were the excited exclamations as the
youngest Rover boy disappeared over the front
end of the clumsy scow which was now being
turned sideways by the force of the waves.</p>

<p>All expected the boy to reappear, and they
waited anxiously for several seconds. Then, as
he failed to show himself, their anxiety turned
to alarm.</p>

<p>“Where is he? Where did he go?” gasped
Jack, peering down from the opening above.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Andy. “He was
pushing on the boathook and it slipped and he
and the pole went down into the water.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose is keeping him down?”
questioned Randy, who was also peering anxiously
from the opening above.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me,” answered his twin. “Gee, this
is fierce!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“He was sucked under!” spluttered Ira Small,
excitedly. “Sucked under! There must be some
kind of a hole under them rocks!”</p>

<p>“If he’s in a hole, we’ve got to get him out,”
returned Jack, and regardless of the danger, he
leaped down into the water beside the scow and
then climbed on board.</p>

<p>Randy quickly followed him. Then the
searchlight was played upon the water where the
youngest of the Rover boys had so mysteriously
disappeared.</p>

<p>“I see the hole in the rocks!” cried Jack, an
instant later. “It’s less than two feet under
water. Here! Give me that rope. You fellows
pull in when I give a jerk. I’ll try to find him.”</p>

<p>In a twinkling the young major fastened one
end of the rope he had indicated around his body
under his arms. Then, without further ado, he
leaped into the ocean. Another wave was coming
in, and this swept him down under the rocks
exactly as it had swept Fred. The young major
felt himself hurled forward, and then, of a sudden,
his feet struck some sloping sand. He
pushed his way onward and presently found himself
standing up in water less than a foot deep
and in almost total darkness.</p>

<p>“Fred! Fred!” he called out, as soon as he
could speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Who is that?” was the quick response, and the
next moment his cousin stood beside him. He
was panting for breath.</p>

<p>“I’ve found the opening,” spluttered the youngest
Rover. “But I didn’t do it in the way I supposed.”</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Jack. But I don’t know how
I’m going to get back—or how you’re going to
get back, either,” went on Fred. And just then
another wave came rushing in on the pair, coming
up to their waists and then receding.</p>

<p>“I’m fast to a rope. You catch hold of me
and we’ll both get out, I think, without a great
deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>“This must be the passageway, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But just now we’d better return to
the scow. The others are all afraid you were
drowned.”</p>

<p>With Fred holding to the rope, they waited until
another wave was coming in and then jerked
upon the line. Then, as the wave receded, they
rushed along with it, protecting themselves as
much as possible from such rocks as might be
over their heads. They felt the line tighten, and
in a few seconds more came out into the daylight
and were hauled close to the scow.</p>

<p>“Fred!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“Gee, but I’m glad you’re all right!”</p>

<p>Such were the cries from Andy and Randy as
the youngest Rover boy and the young major
crawled aboard the scow. They were somewhat
winded, and it was half a minute before they recovered
sufficiently to tell of what they had seen.</p>

<p>“That must be the passageway!” cried Ira
Small excitedly. “Mebby you kin git in it with
a rowboat when the tide is low. Anyway, I think
we ought to investigate.”</p>

<p>The boys thought so, too, and they calculated
that the water would be at its lowest about three
hours later.</p>

<p>“It will be dark by that time,” was Andy’s
comment.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” answered Jack. “I’m going to
see what sort of place that is before I leave this
island.”</p>

<p>“I think we can get in and out of that hole
without a rope,” said Fred. “I mean while the
water covers it. Just the same, it might be a
good thing to fasten a line out here on the rocks
and then carry it inside. Then a fellow could
haul himself out if he had to.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was thought a good one, and
in the end a heavy hawser was fastened on the
rocks and then carried by Jack and Fred through
the opening under water. Then, while the water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
was gradually going down, the others fastened
the scow as best they could, and also entered the
watery passageway under the cliff.</p>

<p>It was not such a hazardous thing to do, nor
so terrifying, when they understood just how the
opening was located. All reached the sandy
beach under the cliff without mishap. They carried
the searchlight, which was of the water-tight
variety, and with the aid of this soon made their
way under the base of the cliff to where there was
a fair-sized opening on the inner side.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” exclaimed Jack, in delight.
“That must be the passageway, beyond a
doubt!”</p>

<p>Once in the open, they saw that the irregular
bowl encircled by the thirteen pointed rocks was
just ahead of them. The path was rough, but
well defined, and they had little trouble in following
it.</p>

<p>“Gee! what a desolate place this is,” remarked
Andy, as they pushed along.</p>

<p>He had good reason for making that remark.
On every side of them were the bare rocks, lying
in all sorts of fantastic shapes. Here and there
were a few stunted bushes and trailing vines.
There was nothing in the way of a jungle; not a
tree showed itself; nor were there any indications
of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“This is what I call stony lonely and no mistake,”
was the way Fred expressed himself.</p>

<p>At last they reached a point almost at the bottom
of the rocky bowl. Now they could gaze
around them and see the thirteen rocky points
quite plainly.</p>

<p>“It’s them thirteen rocks, and no mistake!”
said Ira Small, with satisfaction. “An’ we found
the triangle, too! So that pirates’ gold must be
somewheres close at hand.”</p>

<p>“Unless some one else has been here before us
and taken it away,” answered Jack. “Don’t be
too much disappointed if we find it gone. These
pirate treasures have been hunted for years by
thousands of treasure seekers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m goin’ to make certain if it’s here or
not before I leave this island!” answered the lanky
sailor, determinedly.</p>

<p>It was now growing dark, the setting sun casting
long and grotesque shadows across the hollow
where they were traveling. Soon night came on,
just at a time when they were trying to decide
where the center of the jagged bowl might be.</p>

<p>“We’ll probably have to stay here all night,”
said Jack. “I don’t believe we can do much in
the darkness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on! Let’s do what we can,” cried
Andy, eagerly. He was so excited that for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
time being he had almost forgotten his hurt ankle.</p>

<p>The other boys were equally interested, and it
must be confessed that the lanky sailor was as
wild as any of them. He, too, had forgotten all
about his injured leg, and he strode on over the
rocks, looking in every direction for some sign
that might indicate where the pirates’ gold was
hidden.</p>

<p>It was now so dark that they had only the
searchlight to guide them, and this seemed to be
growing dimmer.</p>

<p>“I suppose the battery is giving out,” said Jack,
and then the thought occurred to each of them:
What would they do if the flashlight failed?
They would then be left in utter darkness, and
even though they carried matches in a waterproof
box there was nothing at hand with which to
build a fire.</p>

<p>They stumbled along for a hundred feet or
more over the rough rocks, and then Fred gave
a sudden cry:</p>

<p>“Look there! Can that be the place?”</p>

<p>All gazed at the spot pointed out, at the same
time centering the rays from the fast-fading flashlight
on the place. They saw a curious mound of
stones, evidently built up by hand. The stones
averaged the size of bricks, and arose in a pyramid
to the height of several feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s it!” yelled Ira Small, excitedly.
“That’s the place! I remember one of
them sailors said there was stones heaped on the
flat rock like the pyramids of Egypt, only, o’
course, not so high!”</p>

<p>“Well, that heap was certainly placed there by
hand and not by nature,” answered Jack. “Come
on, let’s throw the stones aside and see what is
under the pile!”</p>

<p>All set to work, including the lanky sailor, and
it may well be believed that the stones composing
the pyramid were quickly scattered in all directions.
At the bottom, they came upon a flat rock
resting upon four other rocks which evidently
had an opening between them.</p>

<p>“Some rock!” said Jack, as he surveyed it.
“We’ll have our own trouble moving it, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>The searchlight was placed a few feet away,
and the boys and the sailor set to work to move
the heavy flat stone which rested on the four
others. At first they could not budge the stone,
but finally they brought it up on one edge and
let it fall over on the other side. Underneath,
in a square hollow, they saw more small stones,
evidently packed in by hand and tamped down.
They had a job removing two or three of these,
but then the others came up easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“Hello! Here’s a handle of some sort!” exclaimed
Randy, feverishly. “I believe it’s the
handle of a box!”</p>

<p>All saw the handle, which was about five inches
long and so rusted and mildewed they could not
make out of what material it was composed.
Jack and Randy, aided by the old tar, pulled upon
it with might and main and presently brought to
light a small chest evidently of iron, brass, or
some hard wood—what, they could not determine
for at that instant the rays of the flashlight died
away, leaving them in total darkness.</p>

<p>“It’s a chest!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the pirates’ gold is in it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee! why did that light have to go out
just now?” grumbled Andy, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Make a light, somebody. We’ve got to find
out what this thing is!” said Fred.</p>

<p>Jack was already bringing forth the waterproof
match-box, and now he struck one of the matches
and held it over the chest. It was so covered
with mildew and other evidences of age that he
could hardly make out which was the front and
which the back of the receptacle.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we only had a torch or something to
make a fire with!” moaned Andy.</p>

<p>“Wait! I’ve got something!” exclaimed Ira
Small, suddenly, and, diving down into a pocket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
of his jacket, he brought forth a bit of candle
not over two inches in length.</p>

<p>“Picked it up on the yacht,” he explained.
“Thought it might come in handy some time.”</p>

<p>The bit of candle was lit, and then all looked
down the hole to see if anything further might
be there. But only the solid rock met their gaze.</p>

<p>“Smash it open, boys! Smash it open!” went
on the lanky sailor, still as excited as ever. “We
want to see what the box contains before that
candle is burnt up—an’ it won’t last very long.”</p>

<p>They found a small lock on the box, much
rusted and without a key. With rocks they finally
succeeded in smashing the lock. Then they pried
back the lid of the box. A sheet of what had
once evidently been perfectly good leather met
their gaze. The sailor thrust this aside and then
dove both hands into the box, bringing up a
mass of old and much tarnished coins.</p>

<p>“Pirates’ gold!” he exclaimed, excitedly.
“Doubloons! Hundreds of them! We’ve got
the pirates’ gold at last!”</p>

<small>WHAT THE BOX CONTAINED—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Look at the gold!”</p>

<p>“I wonder what it’s worth?”</p>

<p>“Those sailors told the truth, after all!”</p>

<p>Such were some of the exclamations made by
the Rover boys as they gazed at the contents of
the chest pulled out of the rocky hole before
them.</p>

<p>But if they were excited, Ira Small was more
so, and for a few minutes the boys thought the
old tar would go crazy. Again and again he dove
his hands into the chest, to bring up the coins
and let them fall back with a merry clink.</p>

<p>“I knowed we’d find it!” he cried. “Now I’ll
be a rich man fur life!” And then he added
quickly to the boys: “But you’re to have your
share of it, lads. One-half of whatever is here
goes to Jack an’ the rest of you.”</p>

<p>They were still looking over the coins in the
chest when the bit of candle spluttered up and
went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind! I don’t care how dark it is
now,” said Andy. “We’ve found the treasure,
and that’s enough.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to stay here all night,” returned
Jack. “We’ll never be able to find our way out
in the darkness.”</p>

<p>“What do we care?” put in Randy, lightly.
“I don’t believe any wild animals are going to
bother us in this out-of-the-way hole. Those
pirates certainly buried their gold in a spot where
it was hard to find,” he added.</p>

<p>Sitting around in the darkness, the boys and
the old sailor discussed the situation from every
possible angle. They could make only a wild
estimate of what the contents of the chest was
worth, but knew it would run into many thousands
of dollars.</p>

<p>Their exertions that day had worn them out
completely, and presently all were glad to make
themselves as comfortable as possible on the rocks
and go to sleep. They set no guard, and such a
precaution would have been unnecessary, for no
wild animals came to disturb them.</p>

<p>In the morning they took another look at the
contents of the chest, and then, while it was still
early daylight, set out for the passageway under
the cliff. It took them two hours to clamber to
this place and two hours more to get out to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
clumsy scow and rig up a hawser so that they
could haul the chest on board.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got it we don’t want to lose it,”
said Ira Small anxiously, and so the ancient box
was handled with care.</p>

<p>Once aboard the clumsy scow, they set out upon
the return to the wrecked steam yacht.</p>

<p>“We’ll certainly have a story to tell when we
get home,” said Fred to his cousins. “Do you
know, I had half a notion that that story about
pirates’ gold was a fairy yarn.”</p>

<p>“So did I, Fred,” said Randy. “But, of
course, it’s well known that pirates did bury their
treasures around the West Indies.”</p>

<p>Once aboard the wreck, the boys and the old
sailor washed and brushed up the best they could,
and then prepared for themselves a much-needed
meal. After this they sat down to look over the
contents of the chest more carefully and to wait
as patiently as possible for those who might come
to their rescue.</p>

<p>“These are Spanish doubloons all right
enough,” said Jack. “But what they’re worth, I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they’re not all doubloons,” answered
Randy. “Some of these coins seem to be copper.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite a find, anyhow, Randy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I agree with you on that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of the next day a vessel hove
in sight which proved to be an auxiliary cruiser
of the United States Navy. Again the boys and
the old tar set up their signal of distress, and soon
a small boat containing a couple of officers and a
number of men reached the wreck.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” shouted Andy, as they
came up. “Now we’re safe!”</p>

<p>“What vessel is this?” asked one of the officers,
as soon as he had found out who the party
were; and when told he said that the <i>Coryanda</i>
had been reported water-logged and about to
sink two weeks before.</p>

<p>“She belongs to two scientists from Baltimore,”
he said. “They had a valuable collection of wild
animals, snakes and birds on board.”</p>

<p>“So they did!” answered Jack. “And, believe
me, we had some fun with those creatures! A
few of them are dead, and the rest of them were
either drowned or escaped to this island.” And
then he and his cousins and the old tar told their
story.</p>

<p>“Did those two men, Jackson and Borderwell,
who were in the hydroplane and flew over the
wreck, notify you?” questioned Jack, curiously.</p>

<p>“They did,” answered the leading officer.
“They were sent out on a scouting expedition,”
he explained. “After such storms as we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
had lately we often find wrecks floating around
in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>“Well, those men certainly deserve our thanks,”
put in Randy, and the other boys and Ira Small
agreed with him.</p>

<p>Many of the things of value on the wreck were
taken to the cruiser, and then the boys and the
old tar went on board. The cruiser was from
Porto Rico, but was bound for Norfolk, for
which the boys were thankful.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good-bye to the island!” cried Jack,
as they steamed away.</p>

<p>“Yes, and good-bye to whatever of the wild
animals and snakes are left!”</p>

<p>“Gee! what of the monkeys we left tied up?”
questioned Jack, suddenly.</p>

<p>“They’re not tied up,” answered Andy. “I
didn’t have the heart to do it, so I cut them loose
when we were leaving camp.”</p>

<p>The auxiliary cruiser was, of course, supplied
with radio, and the lads lost no time in sending
a message to their parents. A few hours later
came a return message, relayed from New York
City, stating that the fathers of the four boys
were on the way to meet them as soon as they
landed at Norfolk.</p>

<p>It can well be imagined how impatient the boys
were to reach home. Yet every time they thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
of joining their parents and Mary and Martha a
tinge of sadness crept into their minds.</p>

<p>“Poor Ralph, Gif and Spouter!” murmured
Jack. “How we shall miss them!”</p>

<p>When at last Norfolk was reached, the boys
could hardly wait to get ashore. There were
their fathers ready to greet them, and my readers
can rest assured that all received the warmest
kind of welcome.</p>

<p>“We were hoping against hope when your
message came,” declared Dick Rover. “We
thought the motor boat had been lost with all on
board.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been watching all the shipping reports
for days,” added Tom Rover. “We knew there
had been some terrible storms, and the papers
have reported half a dozen wrecks. We were
sure no motor boat could live in such weather.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got bad news,” said Randy, sorrowfully.
“Spouter, Gif and Ralph——”</p>

<p>“Are all safe!” burst in Sam Rover.</p>

<p>“Safe!” came simultaneously from the four
Rover boys.</p>

<p>“Yes, safe! We got a message from them only
yesterday. They were picked up by a vessel
bound for Spain, and they are now on their way
home.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! This is the best yet!” cried Andy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
and tried to do a jig in spite of his hurt ankle.
Later on the poor fellow had to go to a hospital
to have the ankle readjusted. But the operation
was not a severe one, and soon his ankle
was as well as ever.</p>

<p>The old sailor went home with the boys and
was warmly thanked for all the assistance he had
given the lads during their perilous days on the
ocean and on the island.</p>

<p>The contents of the pirates’ chest was gone
over carefully, and then Dick Rover advised that
a well known numismatist be called in.</p>

<p>“What in the world is a numismicks?” demanded
Ira Small, and when he was told what
was meant, he agreed at once that what Dick
Rover had suggested be done.</p>

<p>The numismatist went over all of the coins
carefully and declared many of them valuable,
not only intrinsically, but on account of their
age and rarity. He took charge of the whole
affair, and in the end the treasure brought in
twenty-four thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“An’ half of it goes to the boys. I won’t
have it no other way,” declared the lanky sailor.
And so each of the boys was able to place three
thousand dollars to his own bank account.</p>

<p>“Well, we certainly had great times on that
trip!” declared Randy. “I don’t suppose we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
ever have such strenuous times again.” But
Randy could not look into the future. Strenuous
days were still to come for the boys, and
what some of them were will be related in another
volume, to be entitled “The Rover Boys
on Sunset Trail; or, The Old Miner’s Mysterious
Message.”</p>

<p>It was not until later that the boys learned that
the two scientists from Baltimore who owned the
<i>Coryanda</i> had been saved along with all but two
of those who had been aboard the ill-fated steam
yacht. About the <i>Hildegarde</i> they heard nothing
for many months, but one day Ira Small
turned up with the information that the rum-runner
had been lost in the hurricane and not a
soul had been saved.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, I’m so glad you got back safe and
sound,” said Ruth Stevenson, when she met the
young major. “You can’t imagine how worried
all of us were!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mighty glad to be back, Ruth,” he
answered. “We’re all glad to be back. It was
no fun being cast away on the ocean on that bit
of wreckage and then to get on a water-logged
yacht that had a lot of wild animals and snakes
aboard.”</p>

<p>“What are they going to do about those wild
animals and snakes?” questioned Martha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know and I don’t care,” answered her
brother. “One such experience was enough for
me.”</p>

<p>“I guess it was enough for all of us,” put in
Randy.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t mind having that little
monkey back,” came from Andy. “But as for
the rest of the beasts—not for me!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Here’s a letter from Ralph, Spouter
and Gif!” cried Fred, bursting in upon his cousins.
“They’re coming back to America just as fast as
a steamer can bring them.”</p>

<p>And now, while the Rover boys are reading the
letter from their chums, we will say good-bye.</p>

<p>The author of this series of exciting flying stories
is an experienced aviator. He says, “During my five
years in the army I performed nearly every sort of
flying duty—instructor, test pilot, bombing, photographing
pilot, etc., in every variety of ship, from tiny
scout planes to the gigantic three-motored Italian
Caproni.”</p>

<p>Not only has this author had many experiences as
a flyer; a list of his activities while knocking around
the country includes postal clerk, hobo, actor, writer,
mutton chop salesman, preacher, roughneck in the oil
fields, newspaper man, flyer, scenario writer in Hollywood
and synthetic clown with the Sells Floto Circus.
Having lived an active, daring life, and possessing a
gift for good story telling, he is well qualified to write
these adventures of a red-blooded dare-devil young
American who became one of the country’s greatest
flyers.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
